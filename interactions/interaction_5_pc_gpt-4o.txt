System prompt:
You are a helpful, respectful and honest network configuration assistant.
You provide extended named access control list scripts in Cisco IOS syntax to fulfill the requirements you're given.
You always provide the script as it would be found in a configuration file.
Make sure to use the syntax for *extended* and *named* access control lists.
Make sure to not include any remarks, comments or explanations inside the script. 
Make sure to not include any console navigation commands.
Make sure to give the access control list a representative, brief, alphanumeric name with no punctuation.
When asked to give only the solution code wrap it around triple ticks (```) without specifying any languages.

User prompt:
Please help me figure out the script for an extended named ACL that allows web traffic to server 172.27.8.55, and blocks all other traffic. First help me break down the previous description into all the individual requirements this ACL needs to fulfill

The model's response:
Certainly! To break down the requirements for the extended named ACL that allows web traffic to a specific server while blocking all other traffic, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Traffic Type**: Allow only web traffic. This usually includes HTTP and HTTPS, which use TCP port numbers 80 and 443 respectively.

2. **Destination IP Address**: The web traffic must be directed to the server with the IP address 172.27.8.55.

3. **Source**: The source of the traffic can be any IP address, as there are no specific source IP restrictions mentioned.

4. **Action**:
   - **Permit**: Web traffic (HTTP and HTTPS) to the specific server.
   - **Deny all other traffic**: This means any traffic not matching the permit conditions needs to be blocked. An implicit "deny all" at the end is typical of ACL configurations.

Next, let's write the ACL script that fulfills these specifications. Would you like to see the configuration script?

User prompt:
Now for each requirement identify which protocol, source ip addresses, source wildcard (if applicable), destination ip addresses, destination wildcard (if applicable), and ports (if applicable) are involved

The model's response:
Certainly! Let's identify each component of the requirements:

1. **Allow Web Traffic to the Server**:
   - **Protocol**: TCP (commonly used for HTTP and HTTPS traffic)
   - **Source IP Addresses**: Any IP address is allowed as the source is unspecified, which is represented by `any`.
   - **Source Wildcard**: Not applicable since `any` is used for source.
   - **Destination IP Address**: 172.27.8.55
   - **Destination Wildcard**: 0.0.0.0 (indicating an exact match for the destination IP)
   - **Ports**: 
     - HTTP: Port 80
     - HTTPS: Port 443

2. **Block All Other Traffic**:
   - **Protocol**: All other traffic (implicit deny of anything not explicitly permitted)
   - **Source IP Addresses**: Any IP address (`any`), since the block applies universally.
   - **Source Wildcard**: Not applicable since `any` is used for source.
   - **Destination IP Addresses**: Any IP address (`any`), as this applies to any other destination.
   - **Destination Wildcard**: Not applicable since `any` is used for destination.
   - **Ports**: All other ports are included under implicit deny.

These elements compose the complete set of criteria for the desired ACL configuration. Shall we proceed to create the ACL script?

User prompt:
Now give me the commands that would implement each of those requirements

The model's response:
Here's the configuration script for the extended named access control list based on the requirements:

```
ip access-list extended WebAccessControl
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 80
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 443
 deny ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now tell me the order the commands should be arranged into to fulfill the requirements properly

The model's response:
The commands should be arranged in the following order to fulfill the requirements correctly, ensuring that web traffic is allowed first and all other traffic is subsequently denied:

1. Allow HTTP traffic (TCP port 80) to the server.
2. Allow HTTPS traffic (TCP port 443) to the server.
3. Deny all other traffic.

Here is the properly ordered script:

```
ip access-list extended WebAccessControl
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 80
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 443
 deny ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now give me the command that starts the list and gives it a name

The model's response:
Certainly! The command that starts the access control list and gives it a name is:

```
ip access-list extended WebAccessControl
```

User prompt:
Now put all the commands together to create the full ACL script

The model's response:
Here is the complete ACL script with all commands put together:

```
ip access-list extended WebAccessControl
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 80
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 443
 deny ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now please give me only the solution as only one code snippet so I can store it in a configuration file (without explanations or any other text)

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended WebAccessControl
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 80
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 443
 deny ip any any
```
