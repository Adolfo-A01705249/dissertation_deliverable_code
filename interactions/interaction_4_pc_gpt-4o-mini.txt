System prompt:
You are a helpful, respectful and honest network configuration assistant.
You provide extended named access control list scripts in Cisco IOS syntax to fulfill the requirements you're given.
You always provide the script as it would be found in a configuration file.
Make sure to use the syntax for *extended* and *named* access control lists.
Make sure to not include any remarks, comments or explanations inside the script. 
Make sure to not include any console navigation commands.
Make sure to give the access control list a representative, brief, alphanumeric name with no punctuation.
When asked to give only the solution code wrap it around triple ticks (```) without specifying any languages.

User prompt:
Please help me figure out the script for an extended named ACL that allows all tcp traffic to the address 192.168.10.5 using ports greater than 1023, and blocks all other traffic. First help me break down the previous description into all the individual requirements this ACL needs to fulfill

The model's response:
1. Allow all TCP traffic to the IP address 192.168.10.5.
2. The TCP traffic must use ports greater than 1023.
3. Block all other traffic.

User prompt:
Now for each requirement identify which protocol, source ip addresses, source wildcard (if applicable), destination ip addresses, destination wildcard (if applicable), and ports (if applicable) are involved

The model's response:
1. **Allow all TCP traffic to the IP address 192.168.10.5.**
   - Protocol: TCP
   - Source IP Addresses: Any
   - Source Wildcard: 0.0.0.0
   - Destination IP Addresses: 192.168.10.5
   - Destination Wildcard: 0.0.0.0
   - Ports: Greater than 1023 (use operator for range)

2. **The TCP traffic must use ports greater than 1023.**
   - Protocol: TCP
   - Source IP Addresses: Any
   - Source Wildcard: 0.0.0.0
   - Destination IP Addresses: 192.168.10.5
   - Destination Wildcard: 0.0.0.0
   - Ports: Greater than 1023

3. **Block all other traffic.**
   - Protocol: Any
   - Source IP Addresses: Any
   - Source Wildcard: 0.0.0.0
   - Destination IP Addresses: Any
   - Destination Wildcard: 0.0.0.0
   - Ports: Not applicable

User prompt:
Now give me the commands that would implement each of those requirements

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended AllowTcp192168105
 permit tcp any host 192.168.10.5 eq >1023
 deny ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now tell me the order the commands should be arranged into to fulfill the requirements properly

The model's response:
1. Permit TCP traffic from any source to the IP address 192.168.10.5 on ports greater than 1023.
2. Deny all other IP traffic.

User prompt:
Now give me the command that starts the list and gives it a name

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended AllowTcp192168105
```

User prompt:
Now put all the commands together to create the full ACL script

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended AllowTcp192168105
 permit tcp any host 192.168.10.5 gt 1023
 deny ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now please give me only the solution as only one code snippet so I can store it in a configuration file (without explanations or any other text)

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended AllowTcp192168105
 permit tcp any host 192.168.10.5 gt 1023
 deny ip any any
```
