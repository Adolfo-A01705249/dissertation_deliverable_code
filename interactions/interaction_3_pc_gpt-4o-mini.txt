System prompt:
You are a helpful, respectful and honest network configuration assistant.
You provide extended named access control list scripts in Cisco IOS syntax to fulfill the requirements you're given.
You always provide the script as it would be found in a configuration file.
Make sure to use the syntax for *extended* and *named* access control lists.
Make sure to not include any remarks, comments or explanations inside the script. 
Make sure to not include any console navigation commands.
Make sure to give the access control list a representative, brief, alphanumeric name with no punctuation.
When asked to give only the solution code wrap it around triple ticks (```) without specifying any languages.

User prompt:
Please help me figure out the script for an extended named ACL that blocks all traffic except for the telnet connection from host 10.25.40.1 to host 172.16.5.10. First help me break down the previous description into all the individual requirements this ACL needs to fulfill

The model's response:
The requirements for the extended named access control list based on your description are as follows:

1. The ACL must be named.
2. It must allow Telnet traffic.
3. It must block all other traffic.
4. The Telnet connection is allowed only from host 10.25.40.1 to host 172.16.5.10.
5. The ACL should apply to all traffic except the specified Telnet connection.

These points will guide the creation of the access control list.

User prompt:
Now for each requirement identify which protocol, source ip addresses, source wildcard (if applicable), destination ip addresses, destination wildcard (if applicable), and ports (if applicable) are involved

The model's response:
1. **Allow Telnet traffic**
   - Protocol: TCP
   - Source IP Address: 10.25.40.1
   - Source Wildcard: 0.0.0.0
   - Destination IP Address: 172.16.5.10
   - Destination Wildcard: 0.0.0.0
   - Ports: Source port: any, Destination port: 23

2. **Block all other traffic**
   - Protocol: Any
   - Source IP Address: any
   - Source Wildcard: any
   - Destination IP Address: any
   - Destination Wildcard: any
   - Ports: any

User prompt:
Now give me the commands that would implement each of those requirements

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended TelnetOnly
 permit tcp host 10.25.40.1 host 172.16.5.10 eq 23
 deny ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now tell me the order the commands should be arranged into to fulfill the requirements properly

The model's response:
The commands should be arranged in the following order to fulfill the requirements properly:

1. Permit the Telnet traffic from host 10.25.40.1 to host 172.16.5.10.
2. Deny all other IP traffic.

This order ensures that the specific allowed traffic is processed before the general deny statement.

User prompt:
Now give me the command that starts the list and gives it a name

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended TelnetOnly
```

User prompt:
Now put all the commands together to create the full ACL script

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended TelnetOnly
 permit tcp host 10.25.40.1 host 172.16.5.10 eq 23
 deny ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now please give me only the solution as only one code snippet so I can store it in a configuration file (without explanations or any other text)

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended TelnetOnly
 permit tcp host 10.25.40.1 host 172.16.5.10 eq 23
 deny ip any any
```
