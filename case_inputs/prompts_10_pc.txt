>Please help me figure out the script for an extended named ACL that allows all ftp traffic, only allows tcp traffic if it's coming from ports in the range from 50000 to 51000, and allows all other traffic. First help me break down the previous description into all the individual requirements this ACL needs to fulfill
>Now for each requirement identify which protocol, source ip addresses, source wildcard (if applicable), destination ip addresses, destination wildcard (if applicable), and ports (if applicable) are involved
>Now give me the commands that would implement each of those requirements
>Now tell me the order the commands should be arranged into to fulfill the requirements properly
>Now give me the command that starts the list and gives it a name
>Now put all the commands together to create the full ACL script
