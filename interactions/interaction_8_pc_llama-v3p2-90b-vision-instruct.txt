System prompt:
You are a helpful, respectful and honest network configuration assistant.
You provide extended named access control list scripts in Cisco IOS syntax to fulfill the requirements you're given.
You always provide the script as it would be found in a configuration file.
Make sure to use the syntax for *extended* and *named* access control lists.
Make sure to not include any remarks, comments or explanations inside the script. 
Make sure to not include any console navigation commands.
Make sure to give the access control list a representative, brief, alphanumeric name with no punctuation.
When asked to give only the solution code wrap it around triple ticks (```) without specifying any languages.

User prompt:
Please help me figure out the script for an extended named ACL that allows all traffic from networks in the range from 192.168.0.0/24 to 192.168.3.0/24, and blocks all other traffic. First help me break down the previous description into all the individual requirements this ACL needs to fulfill

The model's response:
Let's break down the requirements into individual points:

1. The ACL should be an extended named ACL, implying that it can make decisions based on source and destination IP addresses, as well as ports.

2. The ACL needs to allow traffic from networks in the range from 192.168.0.0/24 to 192.168.3.0/24.

3. The ACL should block all other traffic that doesn't match the above condition.

User prompt:
Now for each requirement identify which protocol, source ip addresses, source wildcard (if applicable), destination ip addresses, destination wildcard (if applicable), and ports (if applicable) are involved

The model's response:
Let's break down the requirements:

1. The ACL should be an extended named ACL:
   - Protocol: Any (the protocol will be specified in subsequent rules)

2. The ACL needs to allow traffic from networks in the range from 192.168.0.0/24 to 192.168.3.0/24:
   - Protocol: IP (to allow all types of traffic)
   - Source IP addresses: 
     - 192.168.0.0
     - 192.168.1.0
     - 192.168.2.0
     - 192.168.3.0
   - Source Wildcard: 
     - 0.0.0.255 (to cover the entire /24 network)
   - Destination IP addresses: Any
   - Destination Wildcard: Any
   - Ports: Any

3. The ACL should block all other traffic that doesn't match the above condition (implict deny at the end):
   - This will be covered by the implicit deny rule at the end of the ACL

User prompt:
Now give me the commands that would implement each of those requirements

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended AllowSpecifiedNetworks
 permit ip 192.168.0.0 0.0.0.255 any
 permit ip 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any
 permit ip 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255 any
 permit ip 192.168.3.0 0.0.0.255 any
 deny ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now tell me the order the commands should be arranged into to fulfill the requirements properly

The model's response:
The order of the commands is already correct. The rules that allow traffic from the specified networks come before the rule that blocks all other traffic. 

However, note that the "deny ip any any" command at the end is redundant because Cisco ACLs already have an implicit "deny ip any any" at the end, which means all traffic that doesn't match any rule will be denied.

User prompt:
Now give me the command that starts the list and gives it a name

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended AllowSpecifiedNetworks
```

User prompt:
Now put all the commands together to create the full ACL script

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended AllowSpecifiedNetworks
 permit ip 192.168.0.0 0.0.0.255 any
 permit ip 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any
 permit ip 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255 any
 permit ip 192.168.3.0 0.0.0.255 any
```

User prompt:
Now please give me only the solution as only one code snippet so I can store it in a configuration file (without explanations or any other text)

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended AllowSpecifiedNetworks
 permit ip 192.168.0.0 0.0.0.255 any
 permit ip 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any
 permit ip 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255 any
 permit ip 192.168.3.0 0.0.0.255 any
```
