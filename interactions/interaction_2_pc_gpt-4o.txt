System prompt:
You are a helpful, respectful and honest network configuration assistant.
You provide extended named access control list scripts in Cisco IOS syntax to fulfill the requirements you're given.
You always provide the script as it would be found in a configuration file.
Make sure to use the syntax for *extended* and *named* access control lists.
Make sure to not include any remarks, comments or explanations inside the script. 
Make sure to not include any console navigation commands.
Make sure to give the access control list a representative, brief, alphanumeric name with no punctuation.
When asked to give only the solution code wrap it around triple ticks (```) without specifying any languages.

User prompt:
Please help me figure out the script for an extended named ACL that permits all traffic from network 192.168.1.0/24 to network 192.168.2.0/24, and denies all other traffic. First help me break down the previous description into all the individual requirements this ACL needs to fulfill

The model's response:
Sure! Let's break down the description step-by-step:

1. **Permit Traffic**:
   - Source Network: 192.168.1.0/24
   - Destination Network: 192.168.2.0/24
   - This means all protocol types are allowed from the source network to the destination network.

2. **Deny All Other Traffic**:
   - Any traffic not originating from 192.168.1.0/24 to 192.168.2.0/24 should be denied.

Now, based on these requirements, I can provide you with the script for an extended named ACL. Do you want the solution code now?

User prompt:
Now for each requirement identify which protocol, source ip addresses, source wildcard (if applicable), destination ip addresses, destination wildcard (if applicable), and ports (if applicable) are involved

The model's response:
Certainly! Let's identify the specifics for each requirement:

1. **Permit Traffic from 192.168.1.0/24 to 192.168.2.0/24**:
   - **Protocol**: All protocols (which includes IP)
   - **Source IP Address**: 192.168.1.0
   - **Source Wildcard Mask**: 0.0.0.255 (equivalent to /24)
   - **Destination IP Address**: 192.168.2.0
   - **Destination Wildcard Mask**: 0.0.0.255 (equivalent to /24)
   - **Ports**: Not applicable as all protocols are allowed

2. **Deny All Other Traffic**:
   - **Protocol**: All protocols
   - **Source IP Address**: Any not specified by the first permit rule
   - **Source Wildcard Mask**: N/A (applies to all other IPs)
   - **Destination IP Address**: Any not specified by the first permit rule
   - **Destination Wildcard Mask**: N/A (applies to all other IPs)
   - **Ports**: Not applicable as all other traffic is denied

Do you need the solution code based on these details?

User prompt:
Now give me the commands that would implement each of those requirements

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended NetTrafficControl
 permit ip 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255
 deny ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now tell me the order the commands should be arranged into to fulfill the requirements properly

The model's response:
The commands should be arranged in the following order to fulfill the requirements correctly:

1. **Permit specific network traffic** (from 192.168.1.0/24 to 192.168.2.0/24).
2. **Deny all other traffic**.

Here is the command sequence to implement this:

```
ip access-list extended NetTrafficControl
 permit ip 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255
 deny ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now give me the command that starts the list and gives it a name

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended NetTrafficControl
```

User prompt:
Now put all the commands together to create the full ACL script

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended NetTrafficControl
 permit ip 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255
 deny ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now please give me only the solution as only one code snippet so I can store it in a configuration file (without explanations or any other text)

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended NetTrafficControl
 permit ip 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255
 deny ip any any
```
