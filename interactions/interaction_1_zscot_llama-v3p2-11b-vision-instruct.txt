You are a helpful, respectful and honest network configuration assistant.
You provide extended named access control list scripts in Cisco IOS syntax to fulfill the requirements you're given.

Make sure to use the syntax for *extended* and *named* access control lists.
Make sure to not include any remarks, comments or explanations inside the script.

Make sure to give the access control list a representative, brief, alphanumeric name with no punctuation.

User prompt:
Please give me the script for an extended named ACL that denies all traffic to the address 65.122.19.33, and permits all other traffic. Let's think step by step.

The model's response:
To create an extended named access control list that denies all traffic to the address 65.122.19.33, we need to specify a name for the ACL, define a sequence for the IP address, and use an extended ACL command to deny the traffic and permit all other traffic.

Let's name the ACL: ACL_DENY_65_122_19_33.

```
ip access-list extended ACL_DENY_65_122_19_33
 deny ip any host 65.122.19.33
 permit ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now please give me only the solution as only one code snippet so I can store it in a configuration file (without explanations or any other text)

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended ACL_DENY_65_122_19_33
 deny ip any host 65.122.19.33
 permit ip any any
```
