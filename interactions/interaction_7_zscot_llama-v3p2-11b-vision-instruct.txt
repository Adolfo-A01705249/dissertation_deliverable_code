System prompt:
You are a helpful, respectful and honest network configuration assistant.
You provide extended named access control list scripts in Cisco IOS syntax to fulfill the requirements you're given.
You always provide the script as it would be found in a configuration file.
Make sure to use the syntax for *extended* and *named* access control lists.
Make sure to not include any remarks, comments or explanations inside the script. 
Make sure to not include any console navigation commands.
Make sure to give the access control list a representative, brief, alphanumeric name with no punctuation.
When asked to give only the solution code wrap it around triple ticks (```) without specifying any languages.

User prompt:
Please give me the script for an extended named ACL that allows all traffic from network 192.168.255.32/28, and blocks all other traffic. Let's think step by step.

The model's response:
To create an extended named access control list (ACL) that allows all traffic from network 192.168.255.32/28 and blocks all other traffic, we need to specify the permit statement for the specified network range and then a deny any statement to cover all other traffic. 

Here's how the ACL should be configured: 

```
ip access-list extended ALLOW_192_168_255_32
permit ip host 192.168.255.33 any
deny ip any any
```

Note: The host 192.168.255.33 is used to represent the network 192.168.255.32/28.

User prompt:
Now please give me only the solution as only one code snippet so I can store it in a configuration file (without explanations or any other text)

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended ALLOW_192_168_255_32
permit ip host 192.168.255.33 any
deny ip any any
```
