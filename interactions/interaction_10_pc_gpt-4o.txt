System prompt:
You are a helpful, respectful and honest network configuration assistant.
You provide extended named access control list scripts in Cisco IOS syntax to fulfill the requirements you're given.
You always provide the script as it would be found in a configuration file.
Make sure to use the syntax for *extended* and *named* access control lists.
Make sure to not include any remarks, comments or explanations inside the script. 
Make sure to not include any console navigation commands.
Make sure to give the access control list a representative, brief, alphanumeric name with no punctuation.
When asked to give only the solution code wrap it around triple ticks (```) without specifying any languages.

User prompt:
Please help me figure out the script for an extended named ACL that allows all ftp traffic, only allows tcp traffic if it's coming from ports in the range from 50000 to 51000, and allows all other traffic. First help me break down the previous description into all the individual requirements this ACL needs to fulfill

The model's response:
Certainly! Let's break down the requirements for the extended named ACL:

1. **Allow all FTP traffic**:
   - This involves allowing all FTP connections, which utilize TCP ports 20 and 21.

2. **Allow TCP traffic only if it's coming from ports in the range from 50000 to 51000**:
   - This means that any source TCP traffic from ports 50000 to 51000 should be permitted.

3. **Allow all other traffic**:
   - This implies allowing all other traffic regardless of the protocol or ports.

Combining these, the ACL should:
- Permit TCP traffic on ports 20 and 21 for FTP.
- Permit TCP traffic only if the source port is within 50000 to 51000.
- Permit any remaining traffic.

Would you like me to provide the complete ACL script following these breakdowns?

User prompt:
Now for each requirement identify which protocol, source ip addresses, source wildcard (if applicable), destination ip addresses, destination wildcard (if applicable), and ports (if applicable) are involved

The model's response:
Sure! Here is a detailed breakdown for each requirement:

1. **Allow all FTP traffic**:
   - **Protocol**: TCP
   - **Source IP Addresses**: Any
   - **Source Wildcard**: 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 (or "any" in Cisco terms)
   - **Destination IP Addresses**: Any
   - **Destination Wildcard**: 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 (or "any" in Cisco terms)
   - **Ports**: Port 20 (FTP data), Port 21 (FTP control)

2. **Allow TCP traffic only if it's coming from ports in the range from 50000 to 51000**:
   - **Protocol**: TCP
   - **Source IP Addresses**: Any
   - **Source Wildcard**: 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 (or "any" in Cisco terms)
   - **Destination IP Addresses**: Any
   - **Destination Wildcard**: 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 (or "any" in Cisco terms)
   - **Ports**: Source ports in the range from 50000 to 51000

3. **Allow all other traffic**:
   - **Protocol**: IP (to allow all protocols)
   - **Source IP Addresses**: Any
   - **Source Wildcard**: 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 (or "any" in Cisco terms)
   - **Destination IP Addresses**: Any
   - **Destination Wildcard**: 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 (or "any" in Cisco terms)
   - **Ports**: Not applicable

Are there any other details or specificities you'd like to address before I provide the script?

User prompt:
Now give me the commands that would implement each of those requirements

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended AllowFtpAndSpecificTcp
 permit tcp any any eq 20
 permit tcp any any eq 21
 permit tcp any any range 50000 51000
 permit ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now tell me the order the commands should be arranged into to fulfill the requirements properly

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended AllowFtpAndSpecificTcp
 permit tcp any any eq 20
 permit tcp any any eq 21
 permit tcp any range 50000 51000 any
 permit ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now give me the command that starts the list and gives it a name

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended AllowFtpAndSpecificTcp
```

User prompt:
Now put all the commands together to create the full ACL script

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended AllowFtpAndSpecificTcp
 permit tcp any any eq 20
 permit tcp any any eq 21
 permit tcp any range 50000 51000 any
 permit ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now please give me only the solution as only one code snippet so I can store it in a configuration file (without explanations or any other text)

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended AllowFtpAndSpecificTcp
 permit tcp any any eq 20
 permit tcp any any eq 21
 permit tcp any range 50000 51000 any
 permit ip any any
```
