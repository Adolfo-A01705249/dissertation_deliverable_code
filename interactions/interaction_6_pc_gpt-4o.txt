System prompt:
You are a helpful, respectful and honest network configuration assistant.
You provide extended named access control list scripts in Cisco IOS syntax to fulfill the requirements you're given.
You always provide the script as it would be found in a configuration file.
Make sure to use the syntax for *extended* and *named* access control lists.
Make sure to not include any remarks, comments or explanations inside the script. 
Make sure to not include any console navigation commands.
Make sure to give the access control list a representative, brief, alphanumeric name with no punctuation.
When asked to give only the solution code wrap it around triple ticks (```) without specifying any languages.

User prompt:
Please help me figure out the script for an extended named ACL that blocks all traffic from network 192.168.100.0/24 to network 192.168.200.0/24 except for host 192.168.100.50, and allows all other traffic. First help me break down the previous description into all the individual requirements this ACL needs to fulfill

The model's response:
Certainly, let's break down the requirements for the access control list step-by-step:

1. **Block all traffic from network 192.168.100.0/24 to network 192.168.200.0/24:**
   - This implies creating a rule that denies traffic originating from any host in the 192.168.100.0 network when the destination is the 192.168.200.0 network.

2. **Permit traffic for host 192.168.100.50 to network 192.168.200.0/24:**
   - This means traffic from the specific host 192.168.100.50 to the 192.168.200.0 network should be allowed.

3. **Allow all other traffic:**
   - A rule that permits all other traffic, effectively acting as an implicit allow, should be added at the end of the ACL.

With these clarifications in mind, we're ready to construct the script for the ACL.

User prompt:
Now for each requirement identify which protocol, source ip addresses, source wildcard (if applicable), destination ip addresses, destination wildcard (if applicable), and ports (if applicable) are involved

The model's response:
Sure, let's identify the specifics for each requirement:

1. **Block all traffic from network 192.168.100.0/24 to network 192.168.200.0/24:**
   - **Protocol:** All protocols (IP)
   - **Source IP Address:** 192.168.100.0
   - **Source Wildcard:** 0.0.0.255 (to cover all hosts in the /24 network)
   - **Destination IP Address:** 192.168.200.0
   - **Destination Wildcard:** 0.0.0.255 (to cover all hosts in the /24 network)
   - **Ports:** Not applicable (we are blocking all traffic)

2. **Permit traffic for host 192.168.100.50 to network 192.168.200.0/24:**
   - **Protocol:** All protocols (IP)
   - **Source IP Address:** 192.168.100.50
   - **Source Wildcard:** 0.0.0.0 (specific host)
   - **Destination IP Address:** 192.168.200.0
   - **Destination Wildcard:** 0.0.0.255 (to cover all hosts in the /24 network)
   - **Ports:** Not applicable (we are allowing all traffic for this host)

3. **Allow all other traffic:**
   - **Protocol:** All protocols (IP)
   - **Source IP Address:** Any source
   - **Source Wildcard:** Any source
   - **Destination IP Address:** Any destination
   - **Destination Wildcard:** Any destination
   - **Ports:** Not applicable (we are allowing all other traffic) 

These specifications will be used to create each rule in the access control list.

User prompt:
Now give me the commands that would implement each of those requirements

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended AllowHostDenyNetwork
 permit ip host 192.168.100.50 192.168.200.0 0.0.0.255
 deny ip 192.168.100.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.200.0 0.0.0.255
 permit ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now tell me the order the commands should be arranged into to fulfill the requirements properly

The model's response:
The commands should be arranged in the following order to properly fulfill the requirements:

1. The command that permits traffic for host 192.168.100.50 to the network 192.168.200.0/24 should come first. This ensures that this specific exception is matched before any broader denial occurs.

2. The command that denies all traffic from network 192.168.100.0/24 to network 192.168.200.0/24 should come second, as it applies a broader match to deny other traffic from the specified source network to the specified destination network.

3. Finally, the command that allows all other traffic should be last to ensure any traffic not previously matched by a deny or permit statement is allowed.

Putting these in order:

```
ip access-list extended AllowHostDenyNetwork
 permit ip host 192.168.100.50 192.168.200.0 0.0.0.255
 deny ip 192.168.100.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.200.0 0.0.0.255
 permit ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now give me the command that starts the list and gives it a name

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended AllowHostDenyNetwork
```

User prompt:
Now put all the commands together to create the full ACL script

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended AllowHostDenyNetwork
 permit ip host 192.168.100.50 192.168.200.0 0.0.0.255
 deny ip 192.168.100.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.200.0 0.0.0.255
 permit ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now please give me only the solution as only one code snippet so I can store it in a configuration file (without explanations or any other text)

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended AllowHostDenyNetwork
 permit ip host 192.168.100.50 192.168.200.0 0.0.0.255
 deny ip 192.168.100.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.200.0 0.0.0.255
 permit ip any any
```
