User prompt:
Please give me the script for an extended named ACL that blocks all traffic except for the telnet connection from host 10.25.40.1 to host 172.16.5.10. Let's think step by step.

The model's response:
Certainly, here's the requested extended named ACL script:

```
ip access-list extended AllowTelnetOnly
 permit tcp host 10.25.40.1 host 172.16.5.10 eq 23
 deny ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now please give me only the solution as only one code snippet so I can store it in a configuration file (without explanations or any other text)

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended AllowTelnetOnly
 permit tcp host 10.25.40.1 host 172.16.5.10 eq 23
 deny ip any any
```
