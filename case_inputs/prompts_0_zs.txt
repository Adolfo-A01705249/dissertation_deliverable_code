>Please give me the script for an extended named ACL that allows traffic to server 172.27.8.55 only via web, blocks all tcp traffic to servers 172.27.8.53 and 172.27.8.54, and allows all other traffic. Note that web traffic uses ports 80 for http and 443 for https, and that only allowing web traffic to a given server implies blocking all other kind of traffic to said server.
