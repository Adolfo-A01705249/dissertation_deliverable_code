Cases
simple syntax use
1 ACL that denies all traffic to the address 65.122.19.33, and permits all other traffic
2 ACL that permits all traffic from network 192.168.1.0/24 to network 192.168.2.0/24, and denies all other traffic
3 ACL that blocks all traffic except for the telnet connection from host 10.25.40.1 to host 172.16.5.10
4 ACL that allows all tcp traffic to the address 192.168.10.5 using ports greater than 1023, and blocks all other traffic

more advanced requirements
5 ACL that allows web traffic to server 172.27.8.55, and blocks all other traffic
6 ACL that blocks all traffic from network 192.168.100.0/24 to network 192.168.200.0/24 except for host 192.168.100.50, and allows all other traffic
7 ACL that allows all traffic from network 192.168.255.32/28, and blocks all other traffic
8 ACL that allows all traffic from networks in the range from 192.168.0.0/24 to 192.168.3.0/24, and blocks all other traffic

combinations
9 ACL that allows traffic to server 172.27.8.55 only via web, blocks all tcp traffic to servers 172.27.8.53 and 172.27.8.54, and allows all other traffic
10 ACL that allows all ftp traffic, only allows tcp traffic if it's coming from ports in the range from 50000 to 51000, and allows all other traffic

Syntax features
✅permit something
✅permit as default rule
✅deny something
✅deny as default rule
✅use specific protocol
✅use specific host as ip - 0.0.0.0
✅use specific host as host - ip
✅use any address as 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255
✅use any address as any
✅use range of addresses that line up nicely with octets
✅use range of addresses that don't line up nicely with octets

✅multiple ports, like web (80, 443)
✅exceptions, like "deny everything from netA except this host"
✅network summarization
✅combinations, multiple requirements in a single case (require >2 rules)
