System prompt:
You are a helpful, respectful and honest network configuration assistant.
You provide extended named access control list scripts in Cisco IOS syntax to fulfill the requirements you're given.
You always provide the script as it would be found in a configuration file.
Make sure to use the syntax for *extended* and *named* access control lists.
Make sure to not include any remarks, comments or explanations inside the script. 
Make sure to not include any console navigation commands.
Make sure to give the access control list a representative, brief, alphanumeric name with no punctuation.
When asked to give only the solution code wrap it around triple ticks (```) without specifying any languages.

User prompt:
Please help me figure out the script for an extended named ACL that allows traffic to server 172.27.8.55 only via web, blocks all tcp traffic to servers 172.27.8.53 and 172.27.8.54, and allows all other traffic. First help me break down the previous description into all the individual requirements this ACL needs to fulfill

The model's response:
Breaking down the requirements for the extended named ACL:

1. Allow HTTP traffic (TCP port 80) to server 172.27.8.55
2. Allow HTTPS traffic (TCP port 443) to server 172.27.8.55
3. Block all TCP traffic to server 172.27.8.53
4. Block all TCP traffic to server 172.27.8.54
5. Allow all other traffic

User prompt:
Now for each requirement identify which protocol, source ip addresses, source wildcard (if applicable), destination ip addresses, destination wildcard (if applicable), and ports (if applicable) are involved

The model's response:
Here's the detailed breakdown for each requirement:

1. Allow HTTP traffic (TCP port 80) to server 172.27.8.55
   - Protocol: TCP
   - Source IP addresses: Any (not specified, so we'll use 0.0.0.0)
   - Source wildcard: 255.255.255.255 (to match any IP address)
   - Destination IP addresses: 172.27.8.55
   - Destination wildcard: 0.0.0.0 (to match the exact IP address)
   - Ports: eq 80

2. Allow HTTPS traffic (TCP port 443) to server 172.27.8.55
   - Protocol: TCP
   - Source IP addresses: Any (not specified, so we'll use 0.0.0.0)
   - Source wildcard: 255.255.255.255 (to match any IP address)
   - Destination IP addresses: 172.27.8.55
   - Destination wildcard: 0.0.0.0 (to match the exact IP address)
   - Ports: eq 443

3. Block all TCP traffic to server 172.27.8.53
   - Protocol: TCP
   - Source IP addresses: Any (not specified, so we'll use 0.0.0.0)
   - Source wildcard: 255.255.255.255 (to match any IP address)
   - Destination IP addresses: 172.27.8.53
   - Destination wildcard: 0.0.0.0 (to match the exact IP address)
   - Ports: None (to match all TCP ports)

4. Block all TCP traffic to server 172.27.8.54
   - Protocol: TCP
   - Source IP addresses: Any (not specified, so we'll use 0.0.0.0)
   - Source wildcard: 255.255.255.255 (to match any IP address)
   - Destination IP addresses: 172.27.8.54
   - Destination wildcard: 0.0.0.0 (to match the exact IP address)
   - Ports: None (to match all TCP ports)

5. Allow all other traffic
   - Protocol: Any (IP)
   - Source IP addresses: Any (not specified, so we'll use 0.0.0.0)
   - Source wildcard: 255.255.255.255 (to match any IP address)
   - Destination IP addresses: Any (not specified, so we'll use 0.0.0.0)
   - Destination wildcard: 255.255.255.255 (to match any IP address)
   - Ports: None

User prompt:
Now give me the commands that would implement each of those requirements

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended AllowWeb
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq www
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 443
 deny tcp any host 172.27.8.53
 deny tcp any host 172.27.8.54
 permit ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now tell me the order the commands should be arranged into to fulfill the requirements properly

The model's response:
The correct order of the commands should be:

1. Block all TCP traffic to servers 172.27.8.53 and 172.27.8.54 (requirements 3 and 4)
2. Allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic to server 172.27.8.55 (requirements 1 and 2)
3. Allow all other traffic (requirement 5)

The order matters because the ACL will process the traffic rules in sequence, and as soon as it finds a match, it stops processing the rest of the rules. Therefore, the more specific (and restrictive) rules should come first.

So, the correct order is:

```
ip access-list extended AllowWeb
 deny tcp any host 172.27.8.53
 deny tcp any host 172.27.8.54
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq www
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 443
 permit ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now give me the command that starts the list and gives it a name

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended WebServerRules
```

However, to maintain consistency with the previous answer:

```
ip access-list extended AllowWeb
```

User prompt:
Now put all the commands together to create the full ACL script

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended AllowWeb
 deny tcp any host 172.27.8.53
 deny tcp any host 172.27.8.54
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq www
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 443
 permit ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now please give me only the solution as only one code snippet so I can store it in a configuration file (without explanations or any other text)

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended AllowWeb
 deny tcp any host 172.27.8.53
 deny tcp any host 172.27.8.54
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq www
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 443
 permit ip any any
```
