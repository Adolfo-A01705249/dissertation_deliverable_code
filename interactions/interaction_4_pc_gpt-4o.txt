System prompt:
You are a helpful, respectful and honest network configuration assistant.
You provide extended named access control list scripts in Cisco IOS syntax to fulfill the requirements you're given.
You always provide the script as it would be found in a configuration file.
Make sure to use the syntax for *extended* and *named* access control lists.
Make sure to not include any remarks, comments or explanations inside the script. 
Make sure to not include any console navigation commands.
Make sure to give the access control list a representative, brief, alphanumeric name with no punctuation.
When asked to give only the solution code wrap it around triple ticks (```) without specifying any languages.

User prompt:
Please help me figure out the script for an extended named ACL that allows all tcp traffic to the address 192.168.10.5 using ports greater than 1023, and blocks all other traffic. First help me break down the previous description into all the individual requirements this ACL needs to fulfill

The model's response:
Certainly! Let's break down the requirements step by step for your extended named ACL:

1. **Allow TCP traffic:** The ACL should permit TCP traffic.

2. **Destination IP address:** The traffic should be allowed to a specific destination, which is the IP address 192.168.10.5.

3. **Port Numbers:** Only traffic sent to ports greater than 1023 should be allowed.

4. **Block all other traffic:** After permitting the specified TCP traffic, the ACL should block (deny) all other traffic by default.

These steps will ensure the ACL meets your specified requirements. If you need only the script itself, let me know!

User prompt:
Now for each requirement identify which protocol, source ip addresses, source wildcard (if applicable), destination ip addresses, destination wildcard (if applicable), and ports (if applicable) are involved

The model's response:
Certainly! Let's identify the specifics for each requirement:

1. **Allow TCP traffic:**
   - Protocol: TCP
   - Source IP addresses: Any (since not specified)
   - Source Wildcard: Any
   - Destination IP addresses: 192.168.10.5
   - Destination Wildcard: None (specific host)
   - Ports: Greater than 1023

2. **Block all other traffic:**
   - Protocol: Any (applies to all protocols)
   - Source IP addresses: Any
   - Source Wildcard: Any
   - Destination IP addresses: Any
   - Destination Wildcard: Any
   - Ports: All

This breakdown will be used to configure the extended named ACL to fulfill your requirements. If you want the specific ACL script, let me know!

User prompt:
Now give me the commands that would implement each of those requirements

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended AllowTcpToSpecificHost
 permit tcp any host 192.168.10.5 gt 1023
 deny ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now tell me the order the commands should be arranged into to fulfill the requirements properly

The model's response:
The commands should be in the following order to ensure the ACL fulfills the requirements properly:

1. Permit the specified TCP traffic.
2. Deny all other traffic.

The arranged commands are:

```
ip access-list extended AllowTcpToSpecificHost
 permit tcp any host 192.168.10.5 gt 1023
 deny ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now give me the command that starts the list and gives it a name

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended AllowTcpToSpecificHost
```

User prompt:
Now put all the commands together to create the full ACL script

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended AllowTcpToSpecificHost
 permit tcp any host 192.168.10.5 gt 1023
 deny ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now please give me only the solution as only one code snippet so I can store it in a configuration file (without explanations or any other text)

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended AllowTcpToSpecificHost
 permit tcp any host 192.168.10.5 gt 1023
 deny ip any any
```
