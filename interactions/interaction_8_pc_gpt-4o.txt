System prompt:
You are a helpful, respectful and honest network configuration assistant.
You provide extended named access control list scripts in Cisco IOS syntax to fulfill the requirements you're given.
You always provide the script as it would be found in a configuration file.
Make sure to use the syntax for *extended* and *named* access control lists.
Make sure to not include any remarks, comments or explanations inside the script. 
Make sure to not include any console navigation commands.
Make sure to give the access control list a representative, brief, alphanumeric name with no punctuation.
When asked to give only the solution code wrap it around triple ticks (```) without specifying any languages.

User prompt:
Please help me figure out the script for an extended named ACL that allows all traffic from networks in the range from 192.168.0.0/24 to 192.168.3.0/24, and blocks all other traffic. First help me break down the previous description into all the individual requirements this ACL needs to fulfill

The model's response:
Sure, let's break down the requirements for the ACL:

1. **Allow traffic from network 192.168.0.0/24:**
   - Any traffic originating from the IP range 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.0.255 should be allowed.

2. **Allow traffic from network 192.168.1.0/24:**
   - Any traffic originating from the IP range 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255 should be allowed.

3. **Allow traffic from network 192.168.2.0/24:**
   - Any traffic originating from the IP range 192.168.2.0 to 192.168.2.255 should be allowed.

4. **Allow traffic from network 192.168.3.0/24:**
   - Any traffic originating from the IP range 192.168.3.0 to 192.168.3.255 should be allowed.

5. **Block all other traffic:**
   - Any traffic not matching the above specifications should be denied. Since an ACL has an implicit "deny all" at the end, this part will be automatically handled without needing an explicit configuration command for this requirement.

With these requirements in mind, I can now create the ACL script for you. Would you like to proceed?

User prompt:
Now for each requirement identify which protocol, source ip addresses, source wildcard (if applicable), destination ip addresses, destination wildcard (if applicable), and ports (if applicable) are involved

The model's response:
Certainly! Let's identify the components for each requirement:

1. **Allow traffic from network 192.168.0.0/24:**
   - **Protocol:** All protocols (IP)
   - **Source IP Address:** 192.168.0.0
   - **Source Wildcard Mask:** 0.0.0.255
   - **Destination IP Address:** Any (0.0.0.0)
   - **Destination Wildcard Mask:** Any (255.255.255.255)
   - **Ports:** Any

2. **Allow traffic from network 192.168.1.0/24:**
   - **Protocol:** All protocols (IP)
   - **Source IP Address:** 192.168.1.0
   - **Source Wildcard Mask:** 0.0.0.255
   - **Destination IP Address:** Any (0.0.0.0)
   - **Destination Wildcard Mask:** Any (255.255.255.255)
   - **Ports:** Any

3. **Allow traffic from network 192.168.2.0/24:**
   - **Protocol:** All protocols (IP)
   - **Source IP Address:** 192.168.2.0
   - **Source Wildcard Mask:** 0.0.0.255
   - **Destination IP Address:** Any (0.0.0.0)
   - **Destination Wildcard Mask:** Any (255.255.255.255)
   - **Ports:** Any

4. **Allow traffic from network 192.168.3.0/24:**
   - **Protocol:** All protocols (IP)
   - **Source IP Address:** 192.168.3.0
   - **Source Wildcard Mask:** 0.0.0.255
   - **Destination IP Address:** Any (0.0.0.0)
   - **Destination Wildcard Mask:** Any (255.255.255.255)
   - **Ports:** Any

5. **Block all other traffic:**
   - For blocking other traffic, a specific rule is not required due to the implicit "deny all" at the end of the ACL.

With this breakdown, I'm ready to provide you with the ACL script. Would you like me to do that now?

User prompt:
Now give me the commands that would implement each of those requirements

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended Allow192Range
 permit ip 192.168.0.0 0.0.0.255 any
 permit ip 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any
 permit ip 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255 any
 permit ip 192.168.3.0 0.0.0.255 any
```

User prompt:
Now tell me the order the commands should be arranged into to fulfill the requirements properly

The model's response:
The commands are already arranged in the correct order to fulfill the requirements properly. In an access control list, the order of the statements is important because it is processed from top to bottom, and the first rule that matches the traffic is applied. 

Here is the ACL in proper order:

```
ip access-list extended Allow192Range
 permit ip 192.168.0.0 0.0.0.255 any
 permit ip 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any
 permit ip 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255 any
 permit ip 192.168.3.0 0.0.0.255 any
```

The rules need to be in this sequence so that traffic from each specified subnet is allowed, followed by the implicit "deny all" for any traffic not explicitly permitted.

User prompt:
Now give me the command that starts the list and gives it a name

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended Allow192Range
```

User prompt:
Now put all the commands together to create the full ACL script

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended Allow192Range
 permit ip 192.168.0.0 0.0.0.255 any
 permit ip 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any
 permit ip 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255 any
 permit ip 192.168.3.0 0.0.0.255 any
```

User prompt:
Now please give me only the solution as only one code snippet so I can store it in a configuration file (without explanations or any other text)

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended Allow192Range
 permit ip 192.168.0.0 0.0.0.255 any
 permit ip 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any
 permit ip 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255 any
 permit ip 192.168.3.0 0.0.0.255 any
```
