System prompt:
You are a helpful, respectful and honest network configuration assistant.
You provide extended named access control list scripts in Cisco IOS syntax to fulfill the requirements you're given.
You always provide the script as it would be found in a configuration file.
Make sure to use the syntax for *extended* and *named* access control lists.
Make sure to not include any remarks, comments or explanations inside the script. 
Make sure to not include any console navigation commands.
Make sure to give the access control list a representative, brief, alphanumeric name with no punctuation.
When asked to give only the solution code wrap it around triple ticks (```) without specifying any languages.

User prompt:
Please help me figure out the script for an extended named ACL that allows web traffic to server 172.27.8.55, and blocks all other traffic. First help me break down the previous description into all the individual requirements this ACL needs to fulfill

The model's response:
Based on your description, the requirements for the extended named ACL are:

* The ACL should allow web traffic (HTTP and HTTPS) to a specific server with the IP address 172.27.8.55.
* The ACL should block all other traffic.

Breaking down the requirements further:

* The ACL should be an extended named ACL.
* The ACL should allow inbound traffic (not specified, but implied since it's a blocking ACL).
* The ACL should allow web traffic (TCP ports 80 and 443) from any source IP address.
* The ACL should allow responses from the server (172.27.8.55) to any source IP address.
* The ACL should drop (block) all other traffic (.any other source or destination IP address, or any other protocol/ port).

User prompt:
Now for each requirement identify which protocol, source ip addresses, source wildcard (if applicable), destination ip addresses, destination wildcard (if applicable), and ports (if applicable) are involved

The model's response:
Here are the details for each requirement:

1. The ACL should allow web traffic (HTTP and HTTPS).
	* Protocol: TCP
	* Source IP address: Any (0.0.0.0/0)
	* Source wildcard: 0.0.0.0/0
	* Destination IP address: 172.27.8.55
	* Destination wildcard: 255.255.255.255
	* Ports: 80, 443
2. The ACL should allow responses from the server (172.27.8.55).
	* Protocol: Any
	* Source IP address: 172.27.8.55
	* Source wildcard: 255.255.255.255
	* Destination IP address: Any (0.0.0.0/0)
	* Destination wildcard: 0.0.0.0/0
	* Ports: Any
3. The ACL should drop (block) all other traffic.
	* Protocol: Any
	* Source IP address: Any (0.0.0.0/0)
	* Source wildcard: 0.0.0.0/0
	* Destination IP Address: 172.27.8.55/32
	* Destination wildcard: None
	* Ports: Any

User prompt:
Now give me the commands that would implement each of those requirements

The model's response:
Here are the commands that would implement each of the requirements:

1. The ACL should allow web traffic (HTTP and HTTPS).
```
permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 80
permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 443
```
2. The ACL should allow responses from the server (172.27.8.55).
```
permit ip host 172.27.8.55 any
```
3. The ACL should drop (block) all other traffic.
```
deny ip any host 172.27.8.55
```

User prompt:
Now tell me the order the commands should be arranged into to fulfill the requirements properly

The model's response:
To fulfill the requirements, the commands should be arranged in the following order:

```
permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 80
permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 443
permit ip host 172.27.8.55 any
deny ip any host 172.27.8.55
```

This order ensures that:

1. Web traffic to port 80 is permitted.
2. Web traffic to port 443 is permitted.
3. Responses from the server are permitted (this is necessary because the previous rules only permit traffic from the outside to the server, not traffic from the server back to the outside).
4. Any other traffic intended for the server is denied.

User prompt:
Now give me the command that starts the list and gives it a name

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended server_access
```

User prompt:
Now put all the commands together to create the full ACL script

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended server_access
permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 80
permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 443
permit ip host 172.27.8.55 any
deny ip any host 172.27.8.55
```

User prompt:
Now please give me only the solution as only one code snippet so I can store it in a configuration file (without explanations or any other text)

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended server_access
permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 80
permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 443
permit ip host 172.27.8.55 any
deny ip any host 172.27.8.55
```
