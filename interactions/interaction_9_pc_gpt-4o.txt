System prompt:
You are a helpful, respectful and honest network configuration assistant.
You provide extended named access control list scripts in Cisco IOS syntax to fulfill the requirements you're given.
You always provide the script as it would be found in a configuration file.
Make sure to use the syntax for *extended* and *named* access control lists.
Make sure to not include any remarks, comments or explanations inside the script. 
Make sure to not include any console navigation commands.
Make sure to give the access control list a representative, brief, alphanumeric name with no punctuation.
When asked to give only the solution code wrap it around triple ticks (```) without specifying any languages.

User prompt:
Please help me figure out the script for an extended named ACL that allows traffic to server 172.27.8.55 only via web, blocks all tcp traffic to servers 172.27.8.53 and 172.27.8.54, and allows all other traffic. First help me break down the previous description into all the individual requirements this ACL needs to fulfill

The model's response:
Certainly! Let's break down the requirements for the extended named access control list:

1. **Allow traffic to server 172.27.8.55 only via web**:
   - Permit HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) traffic to the server with IP address 172.27.8.55.

2. **Block all TCP traffic to servers 172.27.8.53 and 172.27.8.54**:
   - Deny all TCP traffic to the server with IP address 172.27.8.53.
   - Deny all TCP traffic to the server with IP address 172.27.8.54.

3. **Allow all other traffic**:
   - Permit all unspecified traffic that reaches the ACL.

Now that we have broken down the requirements, I will provide the script for this ACL. If you're ready for the solution, please let me know!

User prompt:
Now for each requirement identify which protocol, source ip addresses, source wildcard (if applicable), destination ip addresses, destination wildcard (if applicable), and ports (if applicable) are involved

The model's response:
Sure! Let's identify the components involved for each requirement:

1. **Allow traffic to server 172.27.8.55 only via web**:
   - **Protocol**: TCP
   - **Source IP Addresses**: Any (implies using `any` or `0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255`)
   - **Source Wildcard**: Not applicable as `any` is used
   - **Destination IP Addresses**: 172.27.8.55
   - **Destination Wildcard**: 0.0.0.0
   - **Ports**: 
     - HTTP: port 80
     - HTTPS: port 443

2. **Block all TCP traffic to servers 172.27.8.53 and 172.27.8.54**:
   - **Protocol**: TCP
   - **Source IP Addresses**: Any (implies using `any` or `0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255`)
   - **Source Wildcard**: Not applicable as `any` is used
   - **Destination IP Addresses**:
     - 172.27.8.53
     - 172.27.8.54
   - **Destination Wildcard**: 0.0.0.0
   - **Ports**: All TCP ports (no specific port)

3. **Allow all other traffic**:
   - This rule implies the use of a final permit for any remaining traffic.
   - **Protocol**: Any
   - **Source IP Addresses**: Any (uses `any`)
   - **Source Wildcard**: Not applicable as `any` is used
   - **Destination IP Addresses**: Any (uses `any`)
   - **Destination Wildcard**: Not applicable as `any` is used
   - **Ports**: Any (no specific port restriction)

With these identified components, we're ready to construct the ACL. Let me know if you want the full script.

User prompt:
Now give me the commands that would implement each of those requirements

The model's response:
Certainly! Here are the commands for each requirement implemented in an extended named ACL:

```
ip access-list extended WebTrafficAccess
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 80
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 443
 deny tcp any host 172.27.8.53
 deny tcp any host 172.27.8.54
 permit ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now tell me the order the commands should be arranged into to fulfill the requirements properly

The model's response:
The order of the commands in an ACL is crucial to ensure the rules are processed correctly. Here is the correct order:

1. Permit web traffic (HTTP and HTTPS) to server 172.27.8.55.
2. Deny all TCP traffic to server 172.27.8.53.
3. Deny all TCP traffic to server 172.27.8.54.
4. Permit all other traffic.

So the arranged commands are:

```
ip access-list extended WebTrafficAccess
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 80
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 443
 deny tcp any host 172.27.8.53
 deny tcp any host 172.27.8.54
 permit ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now give me the command that starts the list and gives it a name

The model's response:
To create and name an extended access control list, use the following command at the beginning of the ACL script:

```
ip access-list extended WebTrafficAccess
```

User prompt:
Now put all the commands together to create the full ACL script

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended WebTrafficAccess
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 80
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 443
 deny tcp any host 172.27.8.53
 deny tcp any host 172.27.8.54
 permit ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now please give me only the solution as only one code snippet so I can store it in a configuration file (without explanations or any other text)

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended WebTrafficAccess
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 80
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 443
 deny tcp any host 172.27.8.53
 deny tcp any host 172.27.8.54
 permit ip any any
```
