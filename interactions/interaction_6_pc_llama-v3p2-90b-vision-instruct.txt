System prompt:
You are a helpful, respectful and honest network configuration assistant.
You provide extended named access control list scripts in Cisco IOS syntax to fulfill the requirements you're given.
You always provide the script as it would be found in a configuration file.
Make sure to use the syntax for *extended* and *named* access control lists.
Make sure to not include any remarks, comments or explanations inside the script. 
Make sure to not include any console navigation commands.
Make sure to give the access control list a representative, brief, alphanumeric name with no punctuation.
When asked to give only the solution code wrap it around triple ticks (```) without specifying any languages.

User prompt:
Please help me figure out the script for an extended named ACL that blocks all traffic from network 192.168.100.0/24 to network 192.168.200.0/24 except for host 192.168.100.50, and allows all other traffic. First help me break down the previous description into all the individual requirements this ACL needs to fulfill

The model's response:
To create the extended named ACL, let's break down the requirements into individual steps:

1. Block all traffic from network 192.168.100.0/24
2. The block should be to network 192.168.200.0/24
3. Allow traffic from host 192.168.100.50
4. Allow all other traffic

User prompt:
Now for each requirement identify which protocol, source ip addresses, source wildcard (if applicable), destination ip addresses, destination wildcard (if applicable), and ports (if applicable) are involved

The model's response:
Here's the breakdown of each requirement:

1. Block all traffic from network 192.168.100.0/24
   - Protocol: All (ip)
   - Source IP: 192.168.100.0
   - Source wildcard: 0.0.0.255
   - Destination IP: Any
   - Destination wildcard: 255.255.255.255
   - Ports: All

2. The block should be to network 192.168.200.0/24
   - (Update to requirement 1)
   - Protocol: All (ip)
   - Source IP: 192.168.100.0
   - Source wildcard: 0.0.0.255
   - Destination IP: 192.168.200.0
   - Destination wildcard: 0.0.0.255
   - Ports: All

3. Allow traffic from host 192.168.100.50
   - Protocol: All (ip)
   - Source IP: 192.168.100.50
   - Source wildcard: 0.0.0.0
   - Destination IP: Any
   - Destination wildcard: 255.255.255.255
   - Ports: All

4. Allow all other traffic
   - Protocol: All (ip)
   - Source IP: Any
   - Source wildcard: 255.255.255.255
   - Destination IP: Any
   - Destination wildcard: 255.255.255.255
   - Ports: All

User prompt:
Now give me the commands that would implement each of those requirements

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended ACLBLOCK
 deny ip 192.168.100.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.200.0 0.0.0.255
 permit ip 192.168.100.50 0.0.0.0 any
 permit ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now tell me the order the commands should be arranged into to fulfill the requirements properly

The model's response:
In Cisco IOS, the order of the ACL entries matters. The ACEs (Access Control List Entries) are evaluated in the order they are entered. Here's the correct order:

1. Allow traffic from host 192.168.100.50 (to avoid blocking it in the general block rule)
2. Block all traffic from network 192.168.100.0/24 to network 192.168.200.0/24
3. Allow all other traffic

```
ip access-list extended ACLBLOCK
 permit ip 192.168.100.50 0.0.0.0 192.168.200.0 0.0.0.255
 deny ip 192.168.100.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.200.0 0.0.0.255
 permit ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now give me the command that starts the list and gives it a name

The model's response:
Here's the complete script with the ip access-list command that starts the list and gives it a name:


```
ip access-list extended ACLBLOCK
 permit ip 192.168.100.50 0.0.0.0 192.168.200.0 0.0.0.255
 deny ip 192.168.100.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.200.0 0.0.0.255
 permit ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now put all the commands together to create the full ACL script

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended ACLBLOCK
 permit ip 192.168.100.50 0.0.0.0 192.168.200.0 0.0.0.255
 permit ip 192.168.100.50 0.0.0.0 any
 deny ip 192.168.100.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.200.0 0.0.0.255
 permit ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now please give me only the solution as only one code snippet so I can store it in a configuration file (without explanations or any other text)

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended ACLBLOCK100200
 permit ip 192.168.100.50 0.0.0.0 192.168.200.0 0.0.0.255
 permit ip 192.168.100.50 0.0.0.0 any
 deny ip 192.168.100.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.200.0 0.0.0.255
 permit ip any any
```
