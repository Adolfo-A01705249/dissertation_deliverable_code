System prompt:
You are a helpful, respectful and honest network configuration assistant.
You provide extended named access control list scripts in Cisco IOS syntax to fulfill the requirements you're given.
You always provide the script as it would be found in a configuration file.
Make sure to use the syntax for *extended* and *named* access control lists.
Make sure to not include any remarks, comments or explanations inside the script. 
Make sure to not include any console navigation commands.
Make sure to give the access control list a representative, brief, alphanumeric name with no punctuation.
When asked to give only the solution code wrap it around triple ticks (```) without specifying any languages.

User prompt:
Please help me figure out the script for an extended named ACL that allows all traffic from networks in the range from 192.168.0.0/24 to 192.168.3.0/24, and blocks all other traffic. First help me break down the previous description into all the individual requirements this ACL needs to fulfill

The model's response:
Here are the individual requirements that this extended named ACL needs to fulfill based on the description:

* The ACL should allow all traffic (i.e., packets of any protocol, source IP address, and destination IP address) from the following networks:
	+ 192.168.0.0/24
	+ 192.168.1.0/24
	+ 192.168.2.0/24
	+ 192.168.3.0/24
* The ACL should block all other traffic from any other network (i.e., if the above network prefixes are not matched, the packet should be dropped).
* The ACL is an extended named ACL, so the script will use the "Extended permit" or "Extended deny" commands to specify the kinds of traffic to allow or block.
* The ACL name should be representative and brief, and contain only alphanumeric characters (no punctuation).

Let me know once these requirements are confirmed, I'll help you create the ACL script.

User prompt:
Now for each requirement identify which protocol, source ip addresses, source wildcard (if applicable), destination ip addresses, destination wildcard (if applicable), and ports (if applicable) are involved

The model's response:
Here are the details for each requirement:

**Requirement 1: Allow all traffic from the listed networks**

* Protocol: Any (represented by `any` in the ACL syntax)
* Source IP address: 192.168.0.0/24
* Source wildcard: 0.0.0.0 ( implied by the prefix length of 24)
* Destination IP address: Any (represented by `any` in the ACL syntax)
* Destination wildcard: 0.0.0.0 (implied by the no destination prefix specified)
* Ports: Any ( default value, which means ports 0-65535 are included)

**Requirement 2: Allow all traffic from network 192.168.1.0/24**

* Protocol: Any (represented by `any` in the ACL syntax)
* Source IP address: 192.168.1.0/24
* Source wildcard: 0.0.0.0 ( implied by the prefix length of 24)
* Destination IP address: Any (represented by `any` in the ACL syntax)
* Destination wildcard: 0.0.0.0 (implied by the no destination prefix specified)
* Ports: Any ( default value, which means ports 0-65535 are included)

**Requirement 3: Allow all traffic from network 192.168.2.0/24**

* Protocol: Any (represented by `any` in the ACL syntax)
* Source IP address: 192.168.2.0/24
* Source wildcard: 0.0.0.0 ( implied by the prefix length of 24)
* Destination IP address: Any (represented by `any` in the ACL syntax)
* Destination wildcard: 0.0.0.0 (implied by the no destination prefix specified)
* Ports: Any ( default value, which means ports 0-65535 are included)

**Requirement 4: Allow all traffic from network 192.168.3.0/24**

* Protocol: Any (represented by `any` in the ACL syntax)
* Source IP address: 192.168.3.0/24
* Source wildcard: 0.0.0.0 ( implied by the prefix length of 24)
* Destination IP address: Any (represented by `any` in the ACL syntax)
* Destination wildcard: 0.0.0.0 (implied by the no destination prefix specified)
* Ports: Any ( default value, which means ports 0-65535 are included)

**Requirement 5: Block all other traffic**

* Protocol: Any (represented by `any` in the ACL syntax)
* Source IP address: Any ( represented by `any` in the ACL syntax)
* Source wildcard: 255.255.255.255 ( implied by the no source prefix specified)
* Destination IP address: Any (represented by `any` in the ACL syntax)
* Destination wildcard: 255.255.255.255 ( implied by the no destination prefix specified)
* Ports: Any ( default value, which means ports 0-65535 are included)

Let me know once you confirm these details, I'll help you create the ACL script.

User prompt:
Now give me the commands that would implement each of those requirements

The model's response:
Here are the individual commands for each requirement:

**Requirement 1: Allow all traffic from the listed networks**

* Command: `ip access-list extended ACL_allow_networks`
*  `permit ip any 192.168.0.0 0.0.0.255 any`
*  `permit ip any 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any`
*  `permit ip any 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255 any`
*  `permit ip any 192.168.3.0 0.0.0.255 any`

**Requirement 5: Block all other traffic**

* Command: `permit ip any any any 224.0.0.0 0.0.255.255`
* **Note**: We cannot use a deny statement here, because after a permit statement in an extended ACL if no matches are made, the packet is not even evaluated, so we add this last permit allowing all traffic from class D networks to any network.

However, we need a deny at the start as we want to deny all traffic by default, for this we will end the current ACL, create a new one in order to correctly deny all traffic not allowed:

* `end`
* `ip access-list extended ACL_deny_all_traffic`
* `deny ip any any`

We combine the two ACLs in the final configuration.

Now, let's combine the scripts.

Here is combined script:
```
ip access-list extended ACL_allow_networks
permit ip any 192.168.0.0 0.0.0.255 any
permit ip any 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any
permit ip any 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255 any
permit ip any 192.168.3.0 0.0.0.255 any
!
ip access-list extended ACL_deny_all_traffic
deny ip any any
!
```

User prompt:
Now tell me the order the commands should be arranged into to fulfill the requirements properly

The model's response:
To fulfill the requirements, we need to arrange the commands in the following order:

1. Create the ACL that allows specific traffic:
```
ip access-list extended ACL_allow_networks
```
2. Permit all traffic from the specified networks:
```
permit ip any 192.168.0.0 0.0.0.255 any
permit ip any 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any
permit ip any 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255 any
permit ip any 192.168.3.0 0.0.0.255 any
```
3. End the current ACL and create a new one to deny all other traffic:
```
end
```
4. Create the ACL that denies all other traffic:
```
ip access-list extended ACL_deny_all_traffic
```
5. Deny all other traffic:
```
deny ip any any
```
However, it's a waste of resources, we can rewrite the allow list to include deny, so we combine the two ACLs together as we did in the previous response.

So, the final suggested configuration remains as is:
```
ip access-list extended ACL_allow_networks
permit ip any 192.168.0.0 0.0.0.255 any
permit ip any 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any
permit ip any 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255 any
permit ip any 192.168.3.0 0.0.0.255 any
!
ip access-list extended ACL_deny_all_traffic
deny ip any any
!
```
(Note that I used `ip access-list extended ABC` instead of using a meaningful abbreviation like I initially did)

User prompt:
Now give me the command that starts the list and gives it a name

The model's response:
To start a new extended named ACL, you can use the following command:

`ip access-list extended ALLOWNETWORKS`

This command starts a new extended access-list named `ALLOWNETWORKS`. 

Here's how it looks wrapped in triple ticks:

```
```
ip access-list extended ALLOWNETWORKS
```
```

User prompt:
Now put all the commands together to create the full ACL script

The model's response:
Here is the full ACL script:

```
```
ip access-list extended ALLOWNETWORKS
permit ip any 192.168.0.0 0.0.0.255 any
permit ip any 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any
permit ip any 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255 any
permit ip any 192.168.3.0 0.0.0.255 any
deny ip any any
```
```

User prompt:
Now please give me only the solution as only one code snippet so I can store it in a configuration file (without explanations or any other text)

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended ALLOWNETWORKS
permit ip any 192.168.0.0 0.0.0.255 any
permit ip any 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any
permit ip any 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255 any
permit ip any 192.168.3.0 0.0.0.255 any
deny ip any any
```
