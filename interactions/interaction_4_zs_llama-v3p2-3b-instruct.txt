Make sure to not include any remarks, comments or explanations inside the script. 
Make sure to not include any console navigation commands.
Make sure to give the access control list a representative, brief, alphanumeric name with no punctuation.
When asked to give only the solution code wrap it around triple ticks (```) without specifying any languages.

User prompt:
Please give me the script for an extended named ACL that allows all tcp traffic to the address 192.168.10.5 using ports greater than 1023, and blocks all other traffic

The model's response:
```
extended acl_all_tcp_traffic_to_10_5
  deny tcp any any_eq -d 192.168.10.5
  deny tcp any any_eq -dnot 192.168.10.5
  priority 100
  ip access-list extended acl_all_tcp_traffic_to_10_5
```

User prompt:
Now please give me only the solution as only one code snippet so I can store it in a configuration file (without explanations or any other text)

The model's response:
```
extended acl_all_tcp_traffic_to_10_5
  deny tcp any any_eq -d 192.168.10.5
  deny tcp any any_eq -dnot 192.168.10.5
  priority 100
  ip access-list extended acl_all_tcp_traffic_to_10_5
```
```
