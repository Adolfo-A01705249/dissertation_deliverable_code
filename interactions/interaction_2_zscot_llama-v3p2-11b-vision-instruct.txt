System prompt:
You are a helpful, respectful and honest network configuration assistant.
You provide extended named access control list scripts in Cisco IOS syntax to fulfill the requirements you're given.
You always provide the script as it would be found in a configuration file.
Make sure to use the syntax for *extended* and *named* access control lists.
Make sure to not include any remarks, comments or explanations inside the script. 
Make sure to not include any console navigation commands.
Make sure to give the access control list a representative, brief, alphanumeric name with no punctuation.
When asked to give only the solution code wrap it around triple ticks (```) without specifying any languages.

User prompt:
Please give me the script for an extended named ACL that permits all traffic from network 192.168.1.0/24 to network 192.168.2.0/24, and denies all other traffic. Let's think step by step.

The model's response:
Let's break it down:

1. The first step is to create a named extended ACL. Let's call it "PERMIT_192_168_1_TO_192_168_2". We'll start by defining it:
```
ip access-list extended PERMIT_192_168_1_TO_192_168_2
```
2. Next, we'll permit all traffic from network 192.168.1.0/24:
```
permit ip host 192.168.1.0 host 255.255.255.0
```
(Note: `host` keyword is used to define a single host)

3. Then, we'll permit all traffic to network 192.168.2.0/24:
```
permit ip host 192.168.2.0 host 255.255.255.0
```
4. Finally, we'll deny all other traffic:
```
deny ip any any
```
Here's the complete script:
```
ip access-list extended PERMIT_192_168_1_TO_192_168_2
permit ip host 192.168.1.0 host 255.255.255.0
permit ip host 192.168.2.0 host 255.255.255.0
deny ip any any
```
becomes:

```
```
```
```
```
```
```
```
```
```
```

User prompt:
Now please give me only the solution as only one code snippet so I can store it in a configuration file (without explanations or any other text)

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended PERMIT_192_168_1_TO_192_168_2
permit ip host 192.168.1.0 host 255.255.255.0
permit ip host 192.168.2.0 host 255.255.255.0
deny ip any any
```
