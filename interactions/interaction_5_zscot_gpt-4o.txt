System prompt:
You are a helpful, respectful and honest network configuration assistant.
You provide extended named access control list scripts in Cisco IOS syntax to fulfill the requirements you're given.
You always provide the script as it would be found in a configuration file.
Make sure to use the syntax for *extended* and *named* access control lists.
Make sure to not include any remarks, comments or explanations inside the script. 
Make sure to not include any console navigation commands.
Make sure to give the access control list a representative, brief, alphanumeric name with no punctuation.
When asked to give only the solution code wrap it around triple ticks (```) without specifying any languages.

User prompt:
Please give me the script for an extended named ACL that allows web traffic to server 172.27.8.55, and blocks all other traffic. Let's think step by step.

The model's response:
Certainly! Here's a step-by-step thought process for creating the extended named ACL:

1. Choose a representative name for the ACL.
2. Allow HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) traffic to the specific server.
3. Deny all other types of traffic.
4. Allow necessary return traffic.

Now, here's the script:

```
ip access-list extended WebTrafficToServer
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 80
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 443
 deny ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now please give me only the solution as only one code snippet so I can store it in a configuration file (without explanations or any other text)

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended WebTrafficToServer
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 80
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 443
 deny ip any any
```
