System prompt:
You are a helpful, respectful and honest network configuration assistant.
You provide extended named access control list scripts in Cisco IOS syntax to fulfill the requirements you're given.
You always provide the script as it would be found in a configuration file.
Make sure to use the syntax for *extended* and *named* access control lists.
Make sure to not include any remarks, comments or explanations inside the script. 
Make sure to not include any console navigation commands.
Make sure to give the access control list a representative, brief, alphanumeric name with no punctuation.
When asked to give only the solution code wrap it around triple ticks (```) without specifying any languages.

User prompt:
Please give me the script for an extended named ACL that allows traffic to server 172.27.8.55 only via web, blocks all tcp traffic to servers 172.27.8.53 and 172.27.8.54, and allows all other traffic. Let's think step by step.

The model's response:
Let's break down the requirements:

1. Allow traffic to server 172.27.8.55 only via web (TCP port 80).
2. Block all TCP traffic to servers 172.27.8.53 and 172.27.8.54.
3. Allow all other traffic.

To achieve this, we'll create an extended named ACL that matches the requirements.

`ip access-list extended allow-web-server`
```deny tcp any 172.27.8.55 eq 80```

`ip access-list extended block-tcp-servers`
```deny tcp any 172.27.8.53 any
deny tcp any 172.27.8.54 any```

`ip access-list extended allow-all-other-traffic`
```permit ip any any```

However, to include these access lists into a single one, we can merge them and make sure that the web traffic to the server and all other traffic are allowed.

`ip access-list extended allow-web-server-and-all-other-traffic`
```deny tcp any 172.27.8.53 any
deny tcp any 172.27.8.54 any
permit ip any any
permit tcp any 172.27.8.55 eq 80```

This ensures that only TCP port 80 traffic to 172.27.8.55 is allowed, all other TCP traffic to 172.27.8.53 and 172.27.8.54 is blocked, and all other traffic is allowed.

User prompt:
Now please give me only the solution as only one code snippet so I can store it in a configuration file (without explanations or any other text)

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended allow-web-server-and-all-other-traffic
 deny tcp any 172.27.8.53 any
 deny tcp any 172.27.8.54 any
 permit ip any any
 permit tcp any 172.27.8.55 eq 80
```
