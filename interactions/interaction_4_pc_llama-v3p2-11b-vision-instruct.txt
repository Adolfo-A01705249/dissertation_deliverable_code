System prompt:
You are a helpful, respectful and honest network configuration assistant.
You provide extended named access control list scripts in Cisco IOS syntax to fulfill the requirements you're given.
You always provide the script as it would be found in a configuration file.
Make sure to use the syntax for *extended* and *named* access control lists.
Make sure to not include any remarks, comments or explanations inside the script. 
Make sure to not include any console navigation commands.
Make sure to give the access control list a representative, brief, alphanumeric name with no punctuation.
When asked to give only the solution code wrap it around triple ticks (```) without specifying any languages.

User prompt:
Please help me figure out the script for an extended named ACL that allows all tcp traffic to the address 192.168.10.5 using ports greater than 1023, and blocks all other traffic. First help me break down the previous description into all the individual requirements this ACL needs to fulfill

The model's response:
Based on your description, the script should fulfill the following requirements:

*   It should be an extended named access control list.
*   It should allow all TCP traffic to the address 192.168.10.5.
*   The allowed TCP traffic should be restricted to ports greater than 1023.
*   All other traffic should be blocked.

Let me know when you're ready to proceed and I'll help you create the script.

User prompt:
Now for each requirement identify which protocol, source ip addresses, source wildcard (if applicable), destination ip addresses, destination wildcard (if applicable), and ports (if applicable) are involved

The model's response:
Here's the breakdown of the requirements:

1.  **Allow all TCP traffic to the address 192.168.10.5**
    *   Protocol: TCP
    *   Source IP addresses: Any (denoted by a wildcard or absence of specification)
    *   Source wildcard: Any (denoted by a wildcard or absence of specification)
    *   Destination IP addresses: 192.168.10.5
    *   Destination wildcard: None
    *   Ports: None (or All)

2.  **The allowed TCP traffic should be restricted to ports greater than 1023**
    *   Protocol: TCP
    *   Source IP addresses: Any (denoted by a wildcard or absence of specification)
    *   Source wildcard: Any (denoted by a wildcard or absence of specification)
    *   Destination IP addresses: 192.168.10.5
    *   Destination wildcard: None
    *   Ports: Greater than port 1023 (`gt 1023`)

3.  **All other traffic should be blocked**
    *   This is a catch-all rule that denies any packets that do not match the previous rule.

Now I can start creating the script. Let me know when you are ready and I will proceed.

User prompt:
Now give me the commands that would implement each of those requirements

The model's response:
Here are the commands that would implement each of the requirements:

1.  \`\`ace permit tcp any any 192.168.10.5 any gt 1023```
2.  This requirement is not directly required, the previous permit rule already includes it, "gt 1023"

3.  ``deny ip any any``

User prompt:
Now tell me the order the commands should be arranged into to fulfill the requirements properly

The model's response:
To fulfill the requirements properly, the commands should be arranged in the following order:

```
```
deny ip any any
permit tcp any any 192.168.10.5 any gt 1023
```

User prompt:
Now give me the command that starts the list and gives it a name

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended allow_tcp_to_19216810_5
```

User prompt:
Now put all the commands together to create the full ACL script

The model's response:
```
```
ip access-list extended allow_tcp_to_19216810_5
deny ip any any
permit tcp any any 192.168.10.5 any gt 1023
```

User prompt:
Now please give me only the solution as only one code snippet so I can store it in a configuration file (without explanations or any other text)

The model's response:
```
```
ip access-list extended allow_tcp_to_19216810_5
deny ip any any
permit tcp any any 192.168.10.5 any gt 1023
```
