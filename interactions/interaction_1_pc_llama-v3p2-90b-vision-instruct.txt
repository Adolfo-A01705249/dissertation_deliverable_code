System prompt:
You are a helpful, respectful and honest network configuration assistant.
You provide extended named access control list scripts in Cisco IOS syntax to fulfill the requirements you're given.
You always provide the script as it would be found in a configuration file.
Make sure to use the syntax for *extended* and *named* access control lists.
Make sure to not include any remarks, comments or explanations inside the script. 
Make sure to not include any console navigation commands.
Make sure to give the access control list a representative, brief, alphanumeric name with no punctuation.
When asked to give only the solution code wrap it around triple ticks (```) without specifying any languages.

User prompt:
Please help me figure out the script for an extended named ACL that denies all traffic to the address 65.122.19.33, and permits all other traffic. First help me break down the previous description into all the individual requirements this ACL needs to fulfill

The model's response:
Let's break down the requirements for the ACL:

1. The ACL type is extended.
2. The ACL is named.
3. The ACL denies all traffic (protocol, ports, etc.) to the specific IP address 65.122.19.33.
4. The ACL permits all other traffic (i.e., any protocol, any source IP, any destination IP except 65.122.19.33, any ports, etc.).

Now that we have a clear understanding of the requirements, we can create a script to fulfill them.

User prompt:
Now for each requirement identify which protocol, source ip addresses, source wildcard (if applicable), destination ip addresses, destination wildcard (if applicable), and ports (if applicable) are involved

The model's response:
Here's the breakdown of the individual components for each requirement:

1. The ACL type is extended.
   (This doesn't need protocol, source ip addresses, etc.)

2. The ACL is named.
   (This doesn't need protocol, source ip addresses, etc.)

3. The ACL denies all traffic to the specific IP address 65.122.19.33.
   - Protocol: ip (all protocols)
   - Source IP Addresses: any
   - Source Wildcard: any
   - Destination IP Addresses: 65.122.19.33
   - Destination Wildcard: 0.0.0.0 (to specify the exact IP)

4. The ACL permits all other traffic.
   - Protocol: ip (all protocols)
   - Source IP Addresses: any
   - Source Wildcard: any
   - Destination IP Addresses: any
   - Destination Wildcard: any

User prompt:
Now give me the commands that would implement each of those requirements

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended DENYTRAFFIC
 deny ip any 65.122.19.33 0.0.0.0
 permit ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now tell me the order the commands should be arranged into to fulfill the requirements properly

The model's response:
In an extended named ACL in Cisco IOS, the most specific rules should come first. The deny rule to a specific IP address should come first, followed by the permit rule to any IP address. If the order is reversed, the permit rule would override the deny rule.

So, the final arrangement of the commands should be the same as before, with the deny rule first:

```
ip access-list extended DENYTRAFFIC
 deny ip any 65.122.19.33 0.0.0.0
 permit ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now give me the command that starts the list and gives it a name

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended DENYTRAFFIC
```

User prompt:
Now put all the commands together to create the full ACL script

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended DENYTRAFFIC
 deny ip any 65.122.19.33 0.0.0.0
 permit ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now please give me only the solution as only one code snippet so I can store it in a configuration file (without explanations or any other text)

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended DENYTRAFFIC
 deny ip any 65.122.19.33 0.0.0.0
 permit ip any any
```
