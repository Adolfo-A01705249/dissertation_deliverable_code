System prompt:
You are a helpful, respectful and honest network configuration assistant.
You provide extended named access control list scripts in Cisco IOS syntax to fulfill the requirements you're given.
You always provide the script as it would be found in a configuration file.
Make sure to use the syntax for *extended* and *named* access control lists.
Make sure to not include any remarks, comments or explanations inside the script. 
Make sure to not include any console navigation commands.
Make sure to give the access control list a representative, brief, alphanumeric name with no punctuation.
When asked to give only the solution code wrap it around triple ticks (```) without specifying any languages.

User prompt:
Please help me figure out the script for an extended named ACL that allows web traffic to server 172.27.8.55, and blocks all other traffic. First help me break down the previous description into all the individual requirements this ACL needs to fulfill

The model's response:
Let's break down the requirements for the extended named ACL:

1. It's an extended ACL (not a standard ACL), which means it can filter based on source and destination IP addresses, as well as ports and protocols.
2. It's a named ACL, which means it will have a descriptive name (alphanumeric, no punctuation).
3. The ACL will allow web traffic (HTTP, typically on port 80, but we'll also consider HTTPS on port 443).
4. The allowed web traffic is destined to a specific server with the IP address 172.27.8.55.
5. All other traffic (not destined to 172.27.8.55 on ports 80 and 443) will be blocked.

Are these requirements correct? Do we need to add anything else?

User prompt:
Now for each requirement identify which protocol, source ip addresses, source wildcard (if applicable), destination ip addresses, destination wildcard (if applicable), and ports (if applicable) are involved

The model's response:
Here are the details for each requirement:

1. Extended ACL:
	* Protocol: Any (no specific protocol is mentioned)
	* Source IP addresses: Any
	* Source wildcard: Any
	* Destination IP addresses: Any
	* Destination wildcard: Any
	* Ports: Any

2. Named ACL:
	* (No specific details about protocol, IP addresses, or ports)

3. Allow web traffic:
	* Protocol: TCP (since HTTP and HTTPS use TCP)
	* Source IP addresses: Any
	* Source wildcard: Any
	* Destination IP addresses: 172.27.8.55
	* Destination wildcard: 0.0.0.0
	* Ports: 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS)

4. Destined to a specific server:
	* (No additional details beyond what's already mentioned in requirement 3)

5. Block all other traffic:
	* Protocol: Any
	* Source IP addresses: Any
	* Source wildcard: Any
	* Destination IP addresses: Any except 172.27.8.55 on ports 80 and 443
	* Destination wildcard: Any except 172.27.8.55 on ports 80 and 443
	* Ports: Any except 80 and 443

Let me know if this helps, or if you need further clarification!

User prompt:
Now give me the commands that would implement each of those requirements

The model's response:
Here are the commands to implement each requirement:


1. Extended ACL:
   Not explicitly needed, as we're already creating an extended ACL.

2. Named ACL:
  ```
ip access-list extended WebTraffic
```

3. Allow web traffic:
   ```
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 80
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 443
```

4. Destined to a specific server:
   (Implemented as part of requirement 3)

5. Block all other traffic:
   ```
 deny ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now tell me the order the commands should be arranged into to fulfill the requirements properly

The model's response:
Here's the complete script with the commands in the correct order:


```
ip access-list extended WebTraffic
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 80
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 443
 deny ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now give me the command that starts the list and gives it a name

The model's response:
This command is already included in the script:


```
ip access-list extended WebTraffic
```

User prompt:
Now put all the commands together to create the full ACL script

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended WebTraffic
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 80
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 443
 deny ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now please give me only the solution as only one code snippet so I can store it in a configuration file (without explanations or any other text)

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended WebTraffic
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 80
 permit tcp any host 172.27.8.55 eq 443
 deny ip any any
```
