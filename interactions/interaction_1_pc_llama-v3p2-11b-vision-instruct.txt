System prompt:
You are a helpful, respectful and honest network configuration assistant.
You provide extended named access control list scripts in Cisco IOS syntax to fulfill the requirements you're given.
You always provide the script as it would be found in a configuration file.
Make sure to use the syntax for *extended* and *named* access control lists.
Make sure to not include any remarks, comments or explanations inside the script. 
Make sure to not include any console navigation commands.
Make sure to give the access control list a representative, brief, alphanumeric name with no punctuation.
When asked to give only the solution code wrap it around triple ticks (```) without specifying any languages.

User prompt:
Please help me figure out the script for an extended named ACL that denies all traffic to the address 65.122.19.33, and permits all other traffic. First help me break down the previous description into all the individual requirements this ACL needs to fulfill

The model's response:
Based on your description, here are the individual requirements this ACL needs to fulfill:

1. This is an extended named ACL.
2. The ACL should deny all traffic to the address 65.122.19.33.
3. The ACL should permit all other traffic.
4. The ACL should have a representative, brief, alphanumeric name.

Let me know if I've correctly identified all the requirements. I'll then be happy to assist you in creating the script.

User prompt:
Now for each requirement identify which protocol, source ip addresses, source wildcard (if applicable), destination ip addresses, destination wildcard (if applicable), and ports (if applicable) are involved

The model's response:
Here are the details for each requirement:

1. This is an extended named ACL:
	* Protocol: *
	* Source IP addresses/Sources: All sources
	* Source Wildcard: N/A
	* Destination IP addresses: N/A
	* Destination Wildcard: N/A
	* Ports: N/A
2. The ACL should deny all traffic to the address 65.122.19.33:
	* Protocol: *
	* Source IP addresses/Sources: *
	* Source Wildcard: N/A
	* Destination IP addresses: 65.122.19.33
	* Destination Wildcard: N/A
	* Ports: N/A
3. The ACL should permit all other traffic:
	* Protocol: *
	* Source IP addresses/Sources: *
	* Source Wildcard: N/A
	* Destination IP addresses: All destinations
	* Destination Wildcard: 0.0.0.0
	* Ports: N/A
4. The ACL should have a representative, brief, alphanumeric name:
	* No specific protocol, source or destination addresses are involved, but rather a generic requirement for the ACL name.

Note that the `*` wildcard denotes "all" for protocols, source and destination addresses.

User prompt:
Now give me the commands that would implement each of those requirements

The model's response:
Here are the commands that would implement each of the requirements:

1. This is an extended named ACL:
```
ip access-list extended ACL-deny-33
```

2. The ACL should deny all traffic to the address 65.122.19.33:
```
permit ip any 65.122.19.33 0.0.0.0
 deny ip any 65.122.19.33 0.0.0.0
```
   OR
```
deny ip any 65.122.19.33 0.0.0.0
```
   Note: Because the deny statement is processed before the permit, the second permit command above is unnecessary. When this line encounters the destination, it will send it to the fast drop, before it even processes the permit above.

User prompt:
Now tell me the order the commands should be arranged into to fulfill the requirements properly

The model's response:
To fulfill the requirements properly, the commands should be arranged as follows:

```
ip access-list extended ACL-deny-33
 deny ip any 65.122.19.33 0.0.0.0
 permit ip any any
```
The order is as follows:

1. Define the extended named ACL.
2. Specify the deny statement for all traffic to the address 65.122.19.33.
3. Per default, after the deny statement, there's an "implicit deny any" which effectively denies all other traffic. This line re-establishes the fact that all other traffic should be allowed.

This arrangement ensures that all traffic to 65.122.19.33 is denied, and all other traffic is permitted.

User prompt:
Now give me the command that starts the list and gives it a name

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended ACL_deny_traffic_to_65_122_19_33
```

User prompt:
Now put all the commands together to create the full ACL script

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended ACL_deny_traffic_to_65_122_19_33
 deny ip any 65.122.19.33 0.0.0.0
 permit ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now please give me only the solution as only one code snippet so I can store it in a configuration file (without explanations or any other text)

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended ACL_deny_traffic_to_65_122_19_33
 deny ip any 65.122.19.33 0.0.0.0
 permit ip any any
```
