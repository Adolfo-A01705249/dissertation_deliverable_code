System prompt:
You are a helpful, respectful and honest network configuration assistant.
You provide extended named access control list scripts in Cisco IOS syntax to fulfill the requirements you're given.
You always provide the script as it would be found in a configuration file.
Make sure to use the syntax for *extended* and *named* access control lists.
Make sure to not include any remarks, comments or explanations inside the script. 
Make sure to not include any console navigation commands.
Make sure to give the access control list a representative, brief, alphanumeric name with no punctuation.
When asked to give only the solution code wrap it around triple ticks (```) without specifying any languages.

User prompt:
Please help me figure out the script for an extended named ACL that blocks all traffic except for the telnet connection from host 10.25.40.1 to host 172.16.5.10. First help me break down the previous description into all the individual requirements this ACL needs to fulfill

The model's response:
Here are the requirements for the extended named ACL:

* The ACL should be an extended named ACL, meaning it will operate at the packet level and will provide detailed information about the packets being filtered.
* The ACL should be named (i.e., it should have a specific name).
* The ACL should block all traffic, meaning it should deny all packets by default.
* There should be an exception for a single telnet connection from a specific host (10.25.40.1).
* The telnet connection should be allowed only to a specific host (172.16.5.10).
* The ACL should be written in Cisco IOS syntax.

Let me know if I've correctly interpreted the requirements, and I'll help you write the script!

User prompt:
Now for each requirement identify which protocol, source ip addresses, source wildcard (if applicable), destination ip addresses, destination wildcard (if applicable), and ports (if applicable) are involved

The model's response:
Here are the details for each requirement:

1. The ACL should block all traffic:
	* Protocol: Any (i.e., all protocols, including TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)
	* Source IP address: N/A, as all sources are being blocked
	* Source wildcard: N/A
	* Destination IP address: N/A, as all destinations are being blocked
	* Destination wildcard: N/A
	* Ports: N/A
2. The ACL should allow a specific telnet connection:
	* Protocol: TCP (specifically, port 23 for telnet)
	* Source IP address: 10.25.40.1
	* Source wildcard: None
	* Destination IP address: 172.16.5.10
	* Destination wildcard: None
	* Ports: Only port 23 (telnet)

User prompt:
Now give me the commands that would implement each of those requirements

The model's response:
Here are the commands that would implement each of the requirements:

1. The ACL should block all traffic:
```
access-list acl_name extended deny ip any any
```

2. The ACL should allow a specific telnet connection:
```
access-list acl_name extended permit tcp host 10.25.40.1 host 172.16.5.10 eq 23
```

User prompt:
Now tell me the order the commands should be arranged into to fulfill the requirements properly

The model's response:
To fulfill the requirements properly, the commands should be arranged in the following order:

1. The command that allows the specific telnet connection:
```
access-list acl_name extended permit tcp host 10.25.40.1 host 172.16.5.10 eq 23
```

2. The command that blocks all other traffic:
```
access-list acl_name extended deny ip any any
```

By placing the permit command before the deny command, the telnet connection from 10.25.40.1 to 172.16.5.10 will be allowed, while all other traffic will be blocked.

User prompt:
Now give me the command that starts the list and gives it a name

The model's response:
```
access-list ALCtrl extended
```

User prompt:
Now put all the commands together to create the full ACL script

The model's response:
``` 
access-list ALCtrl extended
access-list ALCtrl extended permit tcp host 10.25.40.1 host 172.16.5.10 eq 23
access-list ALCtrl extended deny ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now please give me only the solution as only one code snippet so I can store it in a configuration file (without explanations or any other text)

The model's response:
```
access-list ALCtrl extended
access-list ALCtrl extended permit tcp host 10.25.40.1 host 172.16.5.10 eq 23
access-list ALCtrl extended deny ip any any
```
