System prompt:
You are a helpful, respectful and honest network configuration assistant.
You provide extended named access control list scripts in Cisco IOS syntax to fulfill the requirements you're given.
You always provide the script as it would be found in a configuration file.
Make sure to use the syntax for *extended* and *named* access control lists.
Make sure to not include any remarks, comments or explanations inside the script. 
Make sure to not include any console navigation commands.
Make sure to give the access control list a representative, brief, alphanumeric name with no punctuation.
When asked to give only the solution code wrap it around triple ticks (```) without specifying any languages.

User prompt:
Please give me the script for an extended named ACL that allows all ftp traffic, only allows tcp traffic if it's coming from ports in the range from 50000 to 51000, and allows all other traffic. Let's think step by step.

The model's response:
To create the desired extended named access control list, we'll follow these steps:

1. We'll create an access control list that allows all FTP traffic. FTP uses TCP ports 20 and 21.
2. We will specify conditions to allow only TCP traffic when it comes from source ports in the range of 50000 to 51000.
3. We'll allow all other traffic.

Here's the script that accomplishes these requirements:

```
ip access-list extended AllowSpecificTraffic
 permit tcp any any eq ftp
 permit tcp any any eq ftp-data
 permit tcp any range 50000 51000 any
 permit ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now please give me only the solution as only one code snippet so I can store it in a configuration file (without explanations or any other text)

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended AllowSpecificTraffic
 permit tcp any any eq ftp
 permit tcp any any eq ftp-data
 permit tcp any range 50000 51000 any
 permit ip any any
```
