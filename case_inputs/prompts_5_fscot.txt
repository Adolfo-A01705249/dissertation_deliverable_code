>Script for an ACL that permits all traffic to the address 203.0.113.45, and denies all other traffic:

The ACL must:
-permit all kinds of traffic from any source to host 203.0.113.45
-deny the remaining traffic

The corresponding commands are:
```
permit ip any host 203.0.113.45
deny ip any any
```
This order works since the default rule goes last

The full script with a representantive name:
```
ip access-list extended block_host
	permit ip any host 203.0.113.45
	deny ip any any
```

Script for an ACL that denies all traffic from network 172.20.0.0/16 to network 172.21.0.0/16, and permits all other traffic:

-permit the remaining traffic

The corresponding commands are:
```
deny ip any 172.27.240.0 0.0.15.255

Script for an ACL that allows all active ftp traffic to server 192.168.300.35, and
blocks all other traffic

The ACL must:
-permit tcp traffic using active ftp ports (21 and 20) to server 192.168.300.35, since ftp uses the tcp protocol
-deny the remaining traffic

The corresponding commands are:
```
permit tcp any host 192.168.300.35 eq ftp
permit tcp any host 192.168.300.35 eq ftp-data
deny ip any any
```
This order works since the default rule goes last

The full script with a representantive name:
```
ip access-list extended allow_active_ftp
	permit tcp any host 192.168.300.35 eq ftp
	permit tcp any host 192.168.300.35 eq ftp-data
	deny ip any any
```

Script for an ACL that allows all traffic to networks in the range from 192.168.64.0/24 to 192.168.68.0/24, and blocks all other traffic
The full script with a representantive name:

The ACL must:
-permit all kinds of traffic to network 192.168.64.0/20, since that's how the range of networks from 192.168.64.0/24 to 192.168.68.0/24 can be summarized
-deny the remaining traffic

The corresponding commands are:
```
permit ip any 192.168.64.0 0.0.4.255
deny ip any any
```
This order works since the default rule goes last

The full script with a representantive name:
```
ip access-list extended allow_network_range
	permit ip any 192.168.64.0 0.0.4.255
 	deny ip any any
```

Script for an ACL that blocks all tcp traffic to the address 192.168.20.25 using ports less than 1024, and allows all other traffic

The ACL must:
-deny tcp traffic to the address 192.168.20.25 using ports less than 1024
-permit the remaining traffic

The corresponding commands are:
```
deny tcp any host 192.168.20.25 lt 1024
permit ip any any
```
This order works since the default rule goes last

The full script with a representantive name:
```
ip access-list extended block_less_than
	deny tcp any host 192.168.20.25 lt 1024
	permit ip any any
```

Script for an ACL that allows all traffic from network 172.50.0.0/16 to network 172.60.0.0/16 except for host 172.50.45.67, and blocks all other traffic

The ACL must:
-permit all kinds of traffic from network 172.50.0.0/16 to network 172.60.0.0/16 but also block traffic from host 172.50.45.67 to network 172.50.0.0/16
-deny the remaining traffic

The corresponding commands are:
```
deny ip host 172.50.45.67 172.60.0.0 0.0.255.255
permit ip 172.50.0.0 0.0.255.255 172.60.0.0 0.0.255.255
deny ip any any
```
This is the correct order since denying the individual host first ensures that packets from it aren't allowed by the permit rule between the pair of networks, and since the default rule goes last

The full script with a representantive name:
```
ip access-list extended permit_network_except_host
	deny ip host 172.50.45.67 172.60.0.0 0.0.255.255
	permit ip 172.50.0.0 0.0.255.255 172.60.0.0 0.0.255.255
	deny ip any any
```

Script for an ACL that allows tcp traffic from ports in the range from 3000 to 3100, and blocks all other traffic

The ACL must:
-permit tcp traffic from ports in the range from 3000 to 3100
-deny the remaining traffic

The corresponding commands are:
```
permit tcp any any range 3000 3100
deny ip any any
```
This order works since the default rule goes last

The full script with a representantive name:
```
ip access-list extended permit_port_range
	permit tcp any any range 3000 3100
	deny ip any any
```
