System prompt:
You are a helpful, respectful and honest network configuration assistant.
You provide extended named access control list scripts in Cisco IOS syntax to fulfill the requirements you're given.
You always provide the script as it would be found in a configuration file.
Make sure to use the syntax for *extended* and *named* access control lists.
Make sure to not include any remarks, comments or explanations inside the script. 
Make sure to not include any console navigation commands.
Make sure to give the access control list a representative, brief, alphanumeric name with no punctuation.
When asked to give only the solution code wrap it around triple ticks (```) without specifying any languages.

User prompt:
Please help me figure out the script for an extended named ACL that allows all ftp traffic, only allows tcp traffic if it's coming from ports in the range from 50000 to 51000, and allows all other traffic. First help me break down the previous description into all the individual requirements this ACL needs to fulfill

The model's response:
The requirements for the extended named ACL are as follows:

1. Allow all FTP traffic (both incoming and outgoing).
2. Allow TCP traffic only if it originates from source ports in the range from 50000 to 51000.
3. Allow all other traffic (not explicitly denied).

Now, I can provide the script you need based on these requirements. Would you like to proceed with that?

User prompt:
Now for each requirement identify which protocol, source ip addresses, source wildcard (if applicable), destination ip addresses, destination wildcard (if applicable), and ports (if applicable) are involved

The model's response:
Here are the details for each requirement:

1. **Allow all FTP traffic**
   - Protocol: TCP
   - Source IP Addresses: Any (0.0.0.0)
   - Source Wildcard: 0.0.0.0
   - Destination IP Addresses: Any (0.0.0.0)
   - Destination Wildcard: 0.0.0.0
   - Ports: 21 (FTP control) and 20 (FTP data)

2. **Allow TCP traffic only if it originates from ports in the range from 50000 to 51000**
   - Protocol: TCP
   - Source IP Addresses: Any (0.0.0.0)
   - Source Wildcard: 0.0.0.0
   - Destination IP Addresses: Any (0.0.0.0)
   - Destination Wildcard: 0.0.0.0
   - Ports: Source port range 50000 to 51000

3. **Allow all other traffic**
   - Protocol: Any
   - Source IP Addresses: Any (0.0.0.0)
   - Source Wildcard: 0.0.0.0
   - Destination IP Addresses: Any (0.0.0.0)
   - Destination Wildcard: 0.0.0.0
   - Ports: Any

With these specifications, I can create the ACL script for you. Would you like me to do that?

User prompt:
Now give me the commands that would implement each of those requirements

The model's response:
Here are the commands to implement each of the requirements for the extended named ACL:

1. Allow all FTP traffic:
   ```
   ip access-list extended AllowFTP
   permit tcp any any eq 21
   permit tcp any any eq 20
   ```

2. Allow TCP traffic only if it originates from ports in the range from 50000 to 51000:
   ```
   permit tcp any any eq 50000-51000
   ```

3. Allow all other traffic:
   ```
   permit ip any any
   ```

Now I will compile these into a complete access control list script. Would you like to see the final script?

User prompt:
Now tell me the order the commands should be arranged into to fulfill the requirements properly

The model's response:
The commands should be arranged in the following order to fulfill the requirements properly:

1. Allow all FTP traffic
2. Allow TCP traffic only if it originates from ports in the range from 50000 to 51000
3. Allow all other traffic

This order ensures that FTP traffic is prioritized, followed by the specific TCP range, and finally allows any other traffic. Would you like me to provide the complete access control list script in this order?

User prompt:
Now give me the command that starts the list and gives it a name

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended AllowFTPAccess
```

User prompt:
Now put all the commands together to create the full ACL script

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended AllowFTPAccess
permit tcp any any eq 21
permit tcp any any eq 20
permit tcp any any range 50000 51000
permit ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now please give me only the solution as only one code snippet so I can store it in a configuration file (without explanations or any other text)

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended AllowFTPAccess
permit tcp any any eq 21
permit tcp any any eq 20
permit tcp any any range 50000 51000
permit ip any any
```
