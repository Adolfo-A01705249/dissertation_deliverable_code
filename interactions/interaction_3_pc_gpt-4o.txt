System prompt:
You are a helpful, respectful and honest network configuration assistant.
You provide extended named access control list scripts in Cisco IOS syntax to fulfill the requirements you're given.
You always provide the script as it would be found in a configuration file.
Make sure to use the syntax for *extended* and *named* access control lists.
Make sure to not include any remarks, comments or explanations inside the script. 
Make sure to not include any console navigation commands.
Make sure to give the access control list a representative, brief, alphanumeric name with no punctuation.
When asked to give only the solution code wrap it around triple ticks (```) without specifying any languages.

User prompt:
Please help me figure out the script for an extended named ACL that blocks all traffic except for the telnet connection from host 10.25.40.1 to host 172.16.5.10. First help me break down the previous description into all the individual requirements this ACL needs to fulfill

The model's response:
Certainly! Let's break down the requirements for the extended named ACL:

1. **Block All Traffic**: The default action of an ACL is to deny traffic unless explicitly permitted, so all other traffic will be blocked by default.

2. **Allow Specific Traffic**: 
   - Protocol: The ACL needs to permit Telnet traffic, which uses the TCP protocol.
   - Source: The specific host from which the Telnet connection is allowed is 10.25.40.1.
   - Destination: The specific host to which the Telnet connection is allowed is 172.16.5.10.
   - Port: Telnet operates on port 23, so permit traffic to this destination port.

3. **Naming the ACL**: The ACL should have a brief, representative name, focusing on the primary allowed action like "PermitTelnetOnly".

Now that we have outlined the requirements, I will provide the script for the ACL.

User prompt:
Now for each requirement identify which protocol, source ip addresses, source wildcard (if applicable), destination ip addresses, destination wildcard (if applicable), and ports (if applicable) are involved

The model's response:
Certainly, let's identify the specific parameters for each requirement involved in the ACL:

1. **Block All Traffic**:
   - **Protocol**: All protocols (default deny action for unspecified traffic)

2. **Allow Specific Traffic (Telnet from 10.25.40.1 to 172.16.5.10)**:
   - **Protocol**: TCP
   - **Source IP Address**: 10.25.40.1
   - **Source Wildcard**: 0.0.0.0 (used to match the specific host IP address)
   - **Destination IP Address**: 172.16.5.10
   - **Destination Wildcard**: 0.0.0.0 (used to match the specific host IP address)
   - **Ports**: 
     - **Source Port**: Any (not specified in the requirement)
     - **Destination Port**: 23 (Telnet)

User prompt:
Now give me the commands that would implement each of those requirements

The model's response:
Below is the configuration for an extended named ACL that fulfills the specified requirements:

```
ip access-list extended PermitTelnetOnly
 permit tcp host 10.25.40.1 host 172.16.5.10 eq 23
 deny ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now tell me the order the commands should be arranged into to fulfill the requirements properly

The model's response:
The commands should be arranged as follows to properly fulfill the requirements:

1. Start by defining the named access control list.
2. First, include the permit statement for the specific Telnet traffic you wish to allow.
3. Then, include the deny statement to block all other traffic.

Here’s the correct order:

```
ip access-list extended PermitTelnetOnly
 permit tcp host 10.25.40.1 host 172.16.5.10 eq 23
 deny ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now give me the command that starts the list and gives it a name

The model's response:
The command that starts the list and gives it a name is:

```
ip access-list extended PermitTelnetOnly
```

User prompt:
Now put all the commands together to create the full ACL script

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended PermitTelnetOnly
 permit tcp host 10.25.40.1 host 172.16.5.10 eq 23
 deny ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now please give me only the solution as only one code snippet so I can store it in a configuration file (without explanations or any other text)

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended PermitTelnetOnly
 permit tcp host 10.25.40.1 host 172.16.5.10 eq 23
 deny ip any any
```
