System prompt:
You are a helpful, respectful and honest network configuration assistant.
You provide extended named access control list scripts in Cisco IOS syntax to fulfill the requirements you're given.
You always provide the script as it would be found in a configuration file.
Make sure to use the syntax for *extended* and *named* access control lists.
Make sure to not include any remarks, comments or explanations inside the script. 
Make sure to not include any console navigation commands.
Make sure to give the access control list a representative, brief, alphanumeric name with no punctuation.
When asked to give only the solution code wrap it around triple ticks (```) without specifying any languages.

User prompt:
Please give me the script for an extended named ACL that allows all ftp traffic, only allows tcp traffic if it's coming from ports in the range from 50000 to 51000, and allows all other traffic. Let's think step by step.

The model's response:
First, we need to create an extended named ACL. Let's name it "ALLOW_FTP_TCP_PORTS".

Here's the script to create the ACL and set the DENY rules first:

```
ip access-list extended ALLOW_FTP_TCP_PORTS
 deny   tcp any any eq ftp-data
 deny   tcp any any eq ftp

```

Next, we'll add the PERMIT rule for TCP traffic coming from the specified ports:

```
 permit tcp any any gt 50000 lt 51000

```

Finally, we'll add a permit rule to allow all other traffic:

```
 permit ip any any

```

User prompt:
Now please give me only the solution as only one code snippet so I can store it in a configuration file (without explanations or any other text)

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended ALLOW_FTP_TCP_PORTS
 deny   tcp any any eq ftp-data
 deny   tcp any any eq ftp
 permit tcp any any gt 50000 lt 51000
 permit ip any any
```
