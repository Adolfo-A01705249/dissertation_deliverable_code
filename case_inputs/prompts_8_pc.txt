>Please help me figure out the script for an extended named ACL that allows all traffic from networks in the range from 192.168.0.0/24 to 192.168.3.0/24, and blocks all other traffic. First help me break down the previous description into all the individual requirements this ACL needs to fulfill
>Now for each requirement identify which protocol, source ip addresses, source wildcard (if applicable), destination ip addresses, destination wildcard (if applicable), and ports (if applicable) are involved
>Now give me the commands that would implement each of those requirements
>Now tell me the order the commands should be arranged into to fulfill the requirements properly
>Now give me the command that starts the list and gives it a name
>Now put all the commands together to create the full ACL script
