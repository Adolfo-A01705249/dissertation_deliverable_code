System prompt:
You are a helpful, respectful and honest network configuration assistant.
You provide extended named access control list scripts in Cisco IOS syntax to fulfill the requirements you're given.
You always provide the script as it would be found in a configuration file.
Make sure to use the syntax for *extended* and *named* access control lists.
Make sure to not include any remarks, comments or explanations inside the script. 
Make sure to not include any console navigation commands.
Make sure to give the access control list a representative, brief, alphanumeric name with no punctuation.
When asked to give only the solution code wrap it around triple ticks (```) without specifying any languages.

User prompt:
Please help me figure out the script for an extended named ACL that allows all traffic from network 192.168.255.32/28, and blocks all other traffic. First help me break down the previous description into all the individual requirements this ACL needs to fulfill

The model's response:
Certainly! Here's the breakdown of the requirements for the extended named access control list based on your description:

1. **Source Network Allowed**: Allow all traffic from the IP network 192.168.255.32 with a subnet mask of /28. This indicates the range of IP addresses from 192.168.255.32 to 192.168.255.47.

2. **Permit Action**: The ACL should specifically include rules that permit traffic originating from any of the IP addresses within this range.

3. **Deny All Other Traffic**: It implies that any traffic not matching the specified source network should be denied.

Now, I will provide you with the configuration script for this ACL.

User prompt:
Now for each requirement identify which protocol, source ip addresses, source wildcard (if applicable), destination ip addresses, destination wildcard (if applicable), and ports (if applicable) are involved

The model's response:
Certainly! Here's the detailed breakdown of each part of the ACL requirements:

1. **Source Network Allowed**:
   - **Protocol**: All protocols (implied, since no specific protocol is mentioned).
   - **Source IP Addresses**: 192.168.255.32/28. This includes IPs from 192.168.255.32 to 192.168.255.47.
   - **Source Wildcard**: To match this range, the wildcard mask would be 0.0.0.15.
   - **Destination IP Addresses**: Any (since there are no specific destination addresses mentioned).
   - **Destination Wildcard**: Any (there's no limitation specified).
   - **Ports**: Any (since all traffic is to be allowed for this range).

2. **Deny All Other Traffic**:
   - **Protocol**: All protocols (implied, since no specific protocol is mentioned).
   - **Source IP Addresses**: Any traffic not matching the specified source network.
   - **Source Wildcard**: Any (since any other source is to be denied).
   - **Destination IP Addresses**: Any (since there are no specific destination addresses mentioned).
   - **Destination Wildcard**: Any (there's no limitation specified).
   - **Ports**: Any (since all traffic is to be denied).

This breakdown shows that we are dealing with an ACL that broadly controls all protocols and all ports but specifically focuses on a given source network and allows traffic from that network while denying all others.

User prompt:
Now give me the commands that would implement each of those requirements

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended AllowNetwork192
 permit ip 192.168.255.32 0.0.0.15 any
 deny ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now tell me the order the commands should be arranged into to fulfill the requirements properly

The model's response:
The commands should be arranged in the following order to fulfill the requirements properly:

1. Permit traffic from the specified source network.
2. Deny all other traffic.

Here's how the complete access control list should look:

```
ip access-list extended AllowNetwork192
 permit ip 192.168.255.32 0.0.0.15 any
 deny ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now give me the command that starts the list and gives it a name

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended AllowNetwork192
```

User prompt:
Now put all the commands together to create the full ACL script

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended AllowNetwork192
 permit ip 192.168.255.32 0.0.0.15 any
 deny ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now please give me only the solution as only one code snippet so I can store it in a configuration file (without explanations or any other text)

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended AllowNetwork192
 permit ip 192.168.255.32 0.0.0.15 any
 deny ip any any
```
