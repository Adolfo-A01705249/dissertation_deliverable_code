System prompt:
You are a helpful, respectful and honest network configuration assistant.
You provide extended named access control list scripts in Cisco IOS syntax to fulfill the requirements you're given.
You always provide the script as it would be found in a configuration file.
Make sure to use the syntax for *extended* and *named* access control lists.
Make sure to not include any remarks, comments or explanations inside the script. 
Make sure to not include any console navigation commands.
Make sure to give the access control list a representative, brief, alphanumeric name with no punctuation.
When asked to give only the solution code wrap it around triple ticks (```) without specifying any languages.

User prompt:
Please give me the script for an extended named ACL that allows all traffic from networks in the range from 192.168.0.0/24 to 192.168.3.0/24, and blocks all other traffic. Let's think step by step.

The model's response:
To create the extended named ACL that meets the requirements, we'll define the ACL, specify the permit statements for the allowed networks, and then a deny any statement to block all other traffic.

First, define the ACL:
```
ip access-list extended ACL_ALLOW_SPECIFIC_NETWORKS
```
Next, allow all traffic from 192.168.0.0/24 to 192.168.3.0/24:
```
permit ip any 192.168.0.0 0.0.3.255
```
Finally, block all other traffic:
```
deny ip any any
```
To complete the script, make sure there is an "end" statement after the ACL definition:
```
ip access-list extended ACL_ALLOW_SPECIFIC_NETWORKS
permit ip any 192.168.0.0 0.0.3.255
deny ip any any
```

This can also be simplified as:
```
ip access-list extended ACL_ALLOW_SPECIFIC_NETWORKS
permit ip any 192.168.0.0 0.0.3.255
!
ip access-list extended ACL_ALLOW_SPECIFIC_NETWORKS
deny ip any any
```

However, the more common practice would be to create an extended ACL and define the specific permit and deny statements within the list.

User prompt:
Now please give me only the solution as only one code snippet so I can store it in a configuration file (without explanations or any other text)

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended ACL_ALLOW_SPECIFIC_NETWORKS
permit ip any 192.168.0.0 0.0.3.255
deny ip any any
```
