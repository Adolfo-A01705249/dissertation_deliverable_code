System prompt:
You are a helpful, respectful and honest network configuration assistant.
You provide extended named access control list scripts in Cisco IOS syntax to fulfill the requirements you're given.
You always provide the script as it would be found in a configuration file.
Make sure to use the syntax for *extended* and *named* access control lists.
Make sure to not include any remarks, comments or explanations inside the script. 
Make sure to not include any console navigation commands.
Make sure to give the access control list a representative, brief, alphanumeric name with no punctuation.
When asked to give only the solution code wrap it around triple ticks (```) without specifying any languages.

User prompt:
Please help me figure out the script for an extended named ACL that allows all tcp traffic to the address 192.168.10.5 using ports greater than 1023, and blocks all other traffic. First help me break down the previous description into all the individual requirements this ACL needs to fulfill

The model's response:
Let's break down the requirements of the extended named ACL:

1.  The ACL is extended, not standard.
2.  The ACL is named.
3.  The ACL allows all TCP traffic.
4.  The allowed TCP traffic is destined for the IP address 192.168.10.5.
5.  The allowed TCP traffic uses ports greater than 1023.
6.  The ACL blocks all other traffic (not TCP, or TCP not destined for 192.168.10.5, or TCP using ports less than or equal to 1023).

User prompt:
Now for each requirement identify which protocol, source ip addresses, source wildcard (if applicable), destination ip addresses, destination wildcard (if applicable), and ports (if applicable) are involved

The model's response:
Here are the details for each requirement:

1.  The ACL is extended, not standard.
    * Protocol: N/A
    * Source IP addresses: N/A
    * Source wildcard: N/A
    * Destination IP addresses: N/A
    * Destination wildcard: N/A
    * Ports: N/A

2.  The ACL is named.
    * Protocol: N/A
    * Source IP addresses: N/A
    * Source wildcard: N/A
    * Destination IP addresses: N/A
    * Destination wildcard: N/A
    * Ports: N/A

3.  The ACL allows all TCP traffic.
    * Protocol: TCP
    * Source IP addresses: Any
    * Source wildcard: 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255
    * Destination IP addresses: Any is not allowed - see requirement 4
    * Destination wildcard: see requirement 4
    * Ports: Any is not allowed - see requirement 5

4.  The allowed TCP traffic is destined for the IP address 192.168.10.5.
    * Protocol: TCP (inherited from requirement 3)
    * Source IP addresses: Any
    * Source wildcard: 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255
    * Destination IP addresses: 192.168.10.5
    * Destination wildcard: 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0
    * Ports: Any is not allowed - see requirement 5

5.  The allowed TCP traffic uses ports greater than 1023.
    * Protocol: TCP (inherited from requirements 3 and 4)
    * Source IP addresses: Any
    * Source wildcard: 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255
    * Destination IP addresses: 192.168.10.5
    * Destination wildcard: 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0
    * Ports: GT 1023

6.  The ACL blocks all other traffic.
    * Protocol: Any
    * Source IP addresses: Any
    * Source wildcard: 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255
    * Destination IP addresses: Any
    * Destination wildcard: 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 will be used on the first line because that command takes any - while rest of the commands should block other ports of the given TCP
    * Ports: Any is incorrect because we need to block given tcp ports too, hence requirement should be read only with, TCP any, or other than one listed

User prompt:
Now give me the commands that would implement each of those requirements

The model's response:
Here are the Cisco IOS commands to implement each of the requirements:

No command is needed for requirement 1. (it is described when creating the ACL)

Requirement 2:

```
ip access-list extended TcpTo192168105
```

No commands are needed for requirements 3, 4, and 5 - instead the commands below implement requirements 2 through 5 inclusively 

```
permit tcp any 192.168.10.5 0.0.0.0 gt 1023
```

Requirement 6:

```
deny ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now tell me the order the commands should be arranged into to fulfill the requirements properly

The model's response:
Here are the commands in the correct order to fulfill the requirements:

```
ip access-list extended TcpTo192168105
  permit tcp any 192.168.10.5 0.0.0.0 gt 1023
  deny ip any any
```

This order ensures that the permit statement is evaluated first, allowing the desired TCP traffic, and then the deny statement blocks all other traffic.

User prompt:
Now give me the command that starts the list and gives it a name

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended TcpTo192168105
```

This command starts the extended access list and gives it the name "TcpTo192168105".

User prompt:
Now put all the commands together to create the full ACL script

The model's response:
``` 
ip access-list extended TcpTo192168105
  permit tcp any 192.168.10.5 0.0.0.0 gt 1023
  deny ip any any
```

User prompt:
Now please give me only the solution as only one code snippet so I can store it in a configuration file (without explanations or any other text)

The model's response:
```
ip access-list extended TcpTo192168105
  permit tcp any 192.168.10.5 0.0.0.0 gt 1023
  deny ip any any
```
